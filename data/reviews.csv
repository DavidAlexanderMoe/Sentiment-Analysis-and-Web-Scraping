0,Its a beuaty,5,Love its compact shape and sound
1,Perfect upgrade for PC Audio,5,"If you ruining cheap PC Speakers those will blow your mind. Clean sound, small frame, good value for money."
2,Wonderful monitors,5,"It's been some years since using any monitors as I use DT770 250's for all my audio work and wow, I'm so pleased I added these to my studio.

First the sound.

The sound is quite flat which is good as you can accurately EQ your sound. The bass is ""even"", meaning that it's there but it's not exaggerated. The mids are very well balanced (they sound great) and the high end is also fairly well balanced and you can get some nice air and snap when EQing. For those that have the Bayer Dynamic DT770 250"
3,Not loud enough,2,These are probably suited for bedroom use and not anything more. The bass kept cutting out with the highs and mids at times also doing the same. Not great at all - I opted for KrK‚Äôs instead!
4,Faulty,1,"Passive speaker won't connect to the main speaker.. Faulty
Very disappointed"
5,Brilliant monitor speakers for DJ'ing,5,"Absolutely love these speakers - perfect for DJ'ing at home and loud enough for a little boogie with the kids. Sound quality is great and I'm glad I did my research ahead of time. Build quality is really good, the volume pot is nice and smooth.

These would be great for home music production or for gaming.

Well worth the investment."
6,very good but not as good as the harman kardon soundticks,4,"very good but not as good as the harman kardon soundticks

though these are smaller overall"
7,Crackling sound when connected to bluetooth,1,"I‚Äôd like to preface this review by saying I tried 2 different sets of these speakers (both the bluetooth version), brand new, and both had the EXACT same issue, so must be a model issue rather than a one-off problem.

The first pair I bought had a constant crackling/buzzing noise coming from the passive speaker when connected to bluetooth. The noise disappeared when disconnected from bluetooth, but appeared instantly when connected. It was audible at low volumes which ruined the listening experi"
8,These broke after 2 years,1,My speakers broke after a couple of years - useless the amp went inside.
9,impressive sound quality!,5,"bought a pair of these for my daughter, so good I kept them and ordered another pair :-)"
10,Great deal.,5,
11,Excellent,5,Great set of speakers. Good quality sound. Easy connections. Very happy üôÇüëç
12,perfect compact speakers,5,"Item came next day as promised and packaging was minimal but affective, great to see there was not excessive waste on paper !!

The speakers were very easy to connect, if you were not sure how to connect speakers there was some instructions !

to be honest for the size and price, I was very surprised. I have Bang and Olufsen speakers from the 90's which at the time cost ¬£300!! They are exceptional so was very dubious of the sound quality albeit they are for my son and his pc/playstation etc.. th"
13,amazing sound for price,5,"ive been blown away from these speakers for 79.99
they really are studio monitors
may not be the best but are not low quality at all
dont think any speaker in this price point comes closes"
14,Great speakers,5,"Bought these speakers to use for my new gaming pc and they haven‚Äôt disappointed. Well packaged, look and sound great. I often listen to music such as House so wanted speakers that could also have good bass and they would perform. Brilliant for such a low price."
15,Everything you've ever wanted - best sound ever.,5,"PreSonus E5BT Incredible clear sound. These reference speakers are absolutely brilliant for a desktop setup with a laptop or desktop computer. Ideal for small studios. The E5BT gives excellent sound, has lots of functionality, is easy to setup, a pleasure to use. Everything you could want is on the front of the left speaker ‚Äì power, volume, line in, phones out, & BT5 that works very well ‚Äì easy connect anything. The 5 inch driver gives a full clear sound & the rear port adds a solid accurate bas"
16,Did not like at First?,5,"These are near-field monitor speakers designed to have a flat frequency response. This means they need to be closer to you at near-ear height, with speaker separation dependent on distance to form that optimum triangle you complete in the recommended listening position. Unlike consumer speakers with EQ set at speaker level, these provide an uncoloured flat EQ response. This gives a more accurate representation of the input sound source, so now you can mix your audio without adding any unwanted E"
17,Very neutral sonics,5,These are my first pair of studio monitors and I have enjoyed listening to my pc media through them. First noticed how silent they are and neutral in their presentation. Used to use the Q Acoustics BT3 speakers and these certainly have a clearer acoustic. Not producing music but so far very happy with their sound and the construction is more than adequate.
18,Badly manufactured!!,2,"Glue missing on the main cone which resulted in bad vibrations and hissing, not happy with the overall build of these monitors, would not recommend to anyone"
19,Great!,5,"I use them with my Kawai keyboard. Neat, well made, accurate, neutral and crisp. Perfect for my needs, although I am tempted to add an Eris Sub 8, just.... because...."
20,Wicked speakers,5,For the price and size I was blown away by the quality of sound on these. Very loud and good bass with no distortion. Highly recommended
21,Good quality sound,5,Bought for my husbands small music room to link up to all his gadgets! He's pleased with the sound and quality.
22,Up and running,5,"Delivered well and respectfully. Great little speakers with the same power punch aa my previous Mackie 5"" studio monitors which just stopped working. So bought these and they work great üëç. My home studio is up and running again thank goodness."
23,if you make music; buy these!,5,"wow, these are great speakers. small, but powerful enough for my needs as a producer.
I was tempted by another pair that were bluetooth also. im SOOO glad I got these.

registering these speakers gets you some free plugins too. 15 plugins and software (16 if you include the 3 month trial to soundsnap- which I dont) see image of included freebies.

this alone makes these soo worth it.
theres a Plugin Alliance bundle included thats worth over ¬£400 (see images) and you get for free.

in terms of th"
24,Amazing,5,"The sound quality from these is ridiculously good, they are only small and fill the room with vibrant sound. For the price they are incredible, better than my Samsung speakers that I have which cost more than double the price. Highly recommended"
25,These monitors are worth every penny.,4,Very good all round monitors. Excellent value and perfect for the small home studio.
26,"4.5"" Amazing quality and value",5,Had these for a few months now and have just been astounded by the quality for the price point. Hooked these up to my Scarlett Solo 3rd gen audio interface and have never looked back.
27,Compact and sound great,5,I'm use these as speakers for my PC and I'm very happy with them. For the price they sound good and come with a useful selection of inputs. If you're the kind of audiophile who looks for oxygen-free copper cables and gold contacts on your mains plugs then you'll hate them. If you just need some powered speakers for your PC or your kitchen then you'll likely be entirely satisfied.
28,Outstanding for the price,5,As good as advertised and one or two useful VST plugins included!
29,Made big difference in my small bedroom studio.,5,"I use the Presonus sub with a pair of Kali LP6s and adding the sub meant that the monitors have more headroom and the sound in my small studio is so much more enjoyable. Could I master a track using this set up? No. But I have a lot more fun making music now, and for critical listening I use a decent pair of headphones."
30,Wow Amazing!,5,"I didn't expect this much clarity and the base is fantastic. I am using these to produce music ""hobbie"" home studio and they exceeded my expectations for such a great price. You can hear every single channel, instrument, vocals. I would definitely recommend these for sure. Probably the best monitor speakers I have purchased over the years. They are also larger than expected which is a good thing, easy to setup."
31,Very Good Bass reproduction for the Size,5,"Very Good sub For Small to Medium sized room, Very Good Bass from the 8 inch woofer , use it for stereo setup in my Home Theatre, value for money, very good for music, paired it with my Q Accoustics 3030i‚Äôs and NAD 3045 D amp, Bow I get the full Bass missing in Bookshelf speakers, value for money product, Good sturdy build."
32,Virtually unusable due to signal noise,1,"TL;DR: don‚Äôt buy this subwoofer; it‚Äôs a terrible product that hums and hisses.

I really wanted to love this subwoofer, but it‚Äôs basically unusable due to all the noise:

- it always hums when it‚Äôs powered on, even if it‚Äôs not connected to anything. Another reviewer mentioned that‚Äôs a problem with the transformer and they fixed it by adding some padding to the transformer themselves. I can‚Äôt confirm: I don‚Äôt have such technical skills and I don‚Äôt think I should be expected to fix such things mys"
33,cannot believe that sound could so good,5,"cannot believe that sound could be so good.
love the shape of the speakers, and it was easy to setup.
all the controls are in the right place,so easy to operate
would recommend this machine to anyone"
34,Sound For Pound,5,"Love them. Budget dictated these, would probably prefer the next size up but these suit my small room. Will be pairing with Eris Sub8 soon, and that‚Äôll do me for a while. Would‚Äôve definitely had to go for Eris 5 if I couldn‚Äôt fit a sub in the space."
35,Decent,5,"I am not an audiophile freak, But I have been gaming and listening to music through pc speakers for years and can confirm these are the bollox."
36,Fabulous,5,"Bought some creative speakers to replace some old edifier speakers that had died, absolute waste of time for music, gaming even watching a video pod. Bought these after three weeks of creative and the difference is night and day, Double the price of the creatives but ten times the performance, great value for money"
37,This is a real bargain,5,If your budget is tight and looks for a real monitor speakers in a average room. This brand is the way to go.
38,"Boom, boom. Boom",5,Neighbours hate it.
39,"Amazing speakers, terrible software!",4,"These speakers truly are the best sounding speakers I have ever owned, Cristal clear, highs, lows, mids, they honestly are perfect. You will not be disappointed. I managed to get them on Amazon monthly payment plan, which is just amazing! Thank you Amazon!!! :) There is a but, coming up though. The Studio One software that's included with the speakers, is truly horrible to use, and with all of the plug ins and downloads, it took up, 'wait for it' 20 gig of my laptop's memory. 3 days of downloads"
40,Great small monitors,5,"I found these to be very good for the price , def worth the price ."
41,Great desktop speakers,5,"I just use them for listening to music at my desktop, so not as music production monitors. I thought about getting the smaller version with a sub woofer but these produce plenty of bass and sound great."
42,Very good speakers for the price!,5,"These speakers are very good for the price! An excellent addition for desktop speakers.The sound quality is very clear and well balanced. The volume is alot higher when sat infront of the speakers and there is a noticeable drop off when not positioned directly infront of them, but because I've bought them to be predominiently be desktop speakers this isn't an issue for me! The added bluetooth feature is also great and very easy to setup! Very pleased with these speakers."
43,good overall sound small & flexable,5,good little bit of kit
44,"Amazing raw sound for such a low, low price",5,"These are probably the best monitors I have ever purchased. Great raw sound especially when used with your favourite DAW. Would seriously, highly recommend as you won't get anything close to this for cheaper.."
45,Nice looking speakers for my home studio,5,No problems with the speakers except I am getting bit mixed up with setting them up lol I know it‚Äôs just me will have a word with my son he is bit more knowledgeable with pa setting it up .I noticed the manufactures have a support I will use if I get stuck ?
46,The best budget monitors,5,"These studio monitors definitely punch above their weight. Having previously owned various sub-¬£100 monitors, I was expecting these to do the job but not blow me away. When I set them up I found the sound flat and clear - perfect for mixing.

Paired with a speaker EQ software such as SoundID, I've found that I don't feel like I need to upgrade these in the next few years.

One benefit for me is that they don't use much power - I have a small room with only 1 plug socket so needed speakers that w"
47,So happy with this purchase ;),5,"Now I'm a cheapskate.... I needed to replace the cheap PC speakers I was using, so I opted for the cheapest PC speakers on Amazon. Big mistake. Now I'm no audiophile, but these were terrible tinny speakers, and I couldn't bear listening to them a moment longer, so I sent them back immediately!

THEN I ordered these PreSonus studio monitors, and even though they were about 5x as expensive as the previous speakers they are 100% worth it!! These are simply awesome speakers, definitely the best spea"
48,quality product,4,does the job well and well priced
49,Arrived damaged.,1,"I was after a set of smaller monitors for my desktop video editing setup on a recommendation from a friend who has a set, and these fit the bill perfectly. They're loud (surprisingly so!), compact and discreet sat next to my monitors. The sound would normally be excellent I'm sure of it, but unfortunately, the bass woofer on the right side speaker is rattling, even at lower volumes, and there's a distinct rattle when you shake the speaker, so I would assume it's a transit issue. I've mounted the"
50,Speaker quality - great sounding,4,"A friend who is a excellent music producer bought this product and the feedback is : great sounding, superb quality. Perfect speaker size - packaged well. Recommended."
51,Impressive,5,
52,Pairs beautifully,5,"Well, it took three goes and boy; that is less than ideal.

First two had issues and I think the second sub was a return if I‚Äôm being honest.

The thing to watch with this kind of device, anything actively powered, the inbuilt power aspect can cause vibration. The second sub I ordered had a terrible hum which I reduced by getting the volume balanced between the Eris 4.5s and the sub and the interface for my Mac

The first sub just stopped producing bass; which I sent back no issue but the second"
53,"Clear sound, rich in detail",5,"For the price, and considering their size, these monitors are really great. I've been happily using them for general music listening as well as for music production. I highly recommend pairing them with speaker stands as this improved the excellent sound even further. I got the Kanto S2."
54,Excellent,5,"Wow, amazing sound from a 3.5 monitor. Very happy"
55,Very happy,5,"A lot bigger than I expected but no complaints. They look and sound great. Excellent quality for the price, I'm pleasantly surprised!"
56,No nonsense speakers with impressive sound quality,5,"I saw these speakers on a YouTuber's desk setup and he was raving about them. So I figured I'd give them a bash.

I was using the built in speaker on my Macbook or my monitor. Both I found were similar in quality and I felt sound was OK. Nothing spectacular but I felt OK given I'm not a audiophile. It gets the job done and I can listen to YouTube and Spotify OK.

So I was curious how I would find the speakers and if I'd resent the extra space it takes on my desk. I've spent a lot of time/money m"
57,Yeah good value for money,3,"Good speakers for the price.
Clear, accurate, clean speakers which I bought for improving my day to day audio when wfh and either on teams or listening to music.

Would a more ‚Äòdomestic‚Äô speaker have been better than a speaker trying to be a budget monitor speaker, I don‚Äôt know. Probably. Maybe.

But this is good, has Bluetooth, works well and got simple controls with minimum fuss."
58,Fantastic lower price monitors,4,"After trying 2 pairs of refurbished speakers which didn‚Äôt work properly! I bought these brand new, and they‚Äôre perfect for a small home studio."
59,Good speakers with a few reservations,4,"I've only just connected these speakers to my PC (for music, streaming, etc as opposed to gaming) so these are my first impressions.

The sound is pretty good for the speaker size. There is good bass without it being overwhelming (I've increased the bass slightly). I was slightly worried before buying them that I might need to buy a separate cable to connect to my PC, but this proved not to be the case - everything was included (though the instructions were not - see below).

There are a few thi"
60,These speakers are pretty bad,1,"I wanted a small pair of best selling speakers for space saving reasons and to compare my mixes against my Adam A77X.

First off these speakers are in no way professional monitors and any photograph or review telling you otherwise is simply marketing hype and straight up lies. If you do want pro sound from your speakers expect to pay 1k upwards.

These speakers are pretty bad in terms of sound quality dispersing alot of reverberation from the cabinets.

If your buying these don't buy them in ord"
61,Great value for home recording or active listening,5,"Affordable price, Cristal sound and clear bass despite the size of the monitors. Also BT works really nice.

‚ÄúCons‚Äù: these wouldn‚Äôt be my choice for a large room."
62,Great speakers,5,"Great speakers, quality sound and loud volume.
Would definitely recommend!"
63,No good at all for monitors,1,"Sound quality is very bad. It is not my source as they were plugged into a proper desk.

Ok 25 W more like 2W distortion is the only thing they do well. I've heard better from 99p store speakers

Possibly the worst speakers I've ever heard. Sending back for refund. Avoid"
64,Great quality for the PC.,4,Bought these as others in a similar range were larger. They are surprisingly good for a 3.5 inch speaker. Not heard of this make before but they are well made and all the controls and connections are quality. Very pleased on the whole. Might get the 8 inch sub to compliment them although the bass depth is pretty good for the size. At ¬£76 on offer they are a bargain :-)
65,Great quality,5,"Use these monitors for music/music production and gaming, Excellent sound. Very pleased."
66,Adds the boom boom.,5,"Bought to complement a set of desktop Eris e3.5 speakers.

This sub hits hard and is very loud. I had to turn the gain all the way down and it's still borderline too loud sometimes. Resolved the issue by turning the overall system output volume down and turning the speaker gain up to compensate.

I'd recommend connecting the sub / speakers with Y-splitters from your source rather than in series, I encountered a ground loop when connected that way."
67,Excellent speakers for the price!,5,"These are really good reference speakers, the highs and mids are really clear and the bass is present, but nice and tight, the bass compliments the speakers instead of drowning everything out.

Basically you get what you put into these speakers, upgrade your wires and connectors, instead of what comes in the box, and boy do these speakers respond!

You hear what you're supposed to with these speakers, if there's bass in the mix then tight bass is what you get, likewise if there's little to no ba"
68,Sounds fine but there is a fizzing sound even with the gain turned right down,3,They sound good but unfortunately there is a buzz even with the gain turned to zero. I have returned mine to find something else
69,Perfect for people in a tight space,4,Great sound and perfect for small spaces. Recommend if you live in a small apartment/flat but still want quality studio monitors.
70,Perfect for Home Studios,5,"At 50 watts, these are the perfect monitor speakers for someone building out a home studio. They have good bass, treble and a decent mid range. They are wired though, so if you‚Äôre looking for a wireless speaker this isn‚Äôt your option. I would recommend also looking for a different plug if you‚Äôre in the UK as the kettle leaf provided doesn‚Äôt appear to be fused and does not have the British, or EU safety standards adhered to. There isn‚Äôt an option to amend the quality of sound coming through the s"
71,Desktop speakers,5,"Wish I'd bought there years ago, they are simply excellent. As computer desktop speakers and monitors, the sound is out of this world. Excellent."
72,returned as not working,2,Had to return these as they did not work
73,For DJ Deckw,5,I must say these speakers are amazing when I received these I was hoping I did not have to return but these are amazing if you are a looking for dj speakers I would advise you to get a RCA cable with double sides which this is not provided with double RCA cable but apart from that amazing
74,Excellent sound for the price if you can tolerate an ever-present quiet hiss,4,"There is a constant hiss coming from the speakers. It is not particularly loud but it is present regardless of if the volume is turned all the way down or not, and above around 70% volume the hiss gets louder. It is not affected by any adjustments to volume from the source (PC) and the hiss is still present even when there are no cables other than the power attached.

That being said, I do not know whether this is normal for a pair of speakers like this. I upgraded from a pair of Creative Gigawo"
75,My Son is very happy with his new speakers!,5,My 13 year old son did his research to find the best quality speakers for around this price range and these were the best ones he found. He is very happy with them.
76,"Loud, and very clear audio",5,
77,Good speakers for this money. All well thank you. C,5,Good speakers for this money. All well thank you.
78,Great monitors,5,These are great monitors for true clarity
79,good price,5,works just fine if u like bass/subass
80,Astounding Sound Quality,5,"These are by far the best speakers I have ever used on my PC - absolutely stunning sound quality, very clean and not overpowering bass. For the first time I have the EQ setting on neutral to just enjoy the pure clarity that these offer.

Perfect for music, videos and gaming!"
81,Excellent speakers for gaming computers,5,"Well made , quality sound."
82,"Great subwoofer, however needs slight modification",4,"Good sounding subwoofer, works nicely with the Eris 3.5 speakers. However I noticed there was a fairly loud humming noise coming from the transformer.

Transformers make noise by nature however it was quite loud in this sub. I believe it was being caused from the transformer vibrations resonating through the case of the sub due to a poor mount between the case and the transformer.

After reading a review also mentioning this I ended up re-mounting the transformer with some anti vibration washers"
83,Excellent experience,5,"Highly recommend I bought the 3.5‚Äù and will definitely be back for larger speakers in the future, sound quality is great, really wide audio range for gaming, music, or even cinema viewing. Bass & treble knobs on rear for full control. Only thing I don‚Äôt like the led and power button are on opposite sides so trying to turn them off in the darks not optimal but other than that"
84,No repair option outside of warranty,1,"The product in question worked well for the full warranty period and stopped working 15 days after the two year warranty. Amazon were unable to assist (reasonable as outside of warranty) and PreSonus support's response has been ""The cost of transport to a repair centre, the repair and return shipping is not cost effective in comparison to the purchase of a new pair with a full warranty.""

The above is very poor from an environmental perspective as it pushes repairable equipment to waste without "
85,"Excellent sound quality, particularly for the price, accurate Full Range Flat Response",5,"Works well as PC monitor, also as a monitor for guitar multi-effects pedal, with stereo output directly to the powered speaker."
86,Broke not long after the warranty ran out,2,"The monitors started to crackle a few days ago, particularly when playing content with bass. The crackling grew increasingly worse and the have now failed completely. Presonus customer support was very poor. They sent me a few stock questions, the answers to which I had mostly already covered in my initial note to them, and then refused to engage further once I showed them the invoice and could see it was out of warranty. I was not offered the opportunity of a paid repair, which is very poor in "
87,Quality,5,Quite nice product
88,Sound Quality quite good,5,"The sound quality is crisp and adequate for the price. As I have become accustomed to Bose products I tend to be hard to please, so my rating is for the price point."
89,Used as Piano Speakers,5,"I bought these to use as powered speakers to go with a Kawai ES110 electric piano. They are brilliant. They sound good, are compact, easy to set up and are a good way to get a good sound without having to complicate things. In fact, you don't even set them up; you just connect and turn on. Easily worth the money and totally recommended to run your keyboard through.
Not used for gaming so can't judge that but I have no doubt these speakers will sound good for that as well."
90,these cannot be surely reference speakers,1,"Spend more for better quality, otherwise these would be great for watching Linus on YouTube."
91,Great sound,5,"I have a small studio were I do my video editing and they are the perfect size. Very clear sound, I can now hear lots more detail."
92,"Very good clarity, vocals and even bass sound better than expected",5,"After lots of research got it down to two sets for consideration, these and the Edifier R1700BT, after many video reviews and careful listening, i preferred how the bass sounded on the Edifier R1700BT, but the rest sounded a little muddy, the PreSonus Eris E4.5 sound more clear but lacked the same bass sound the Edifier R1700BT produced, hard to tell for sure via youtube review over your own headset for sure, perfect world would have liked to had the two on my desk to review, but as it goes the "
93,Brilliant for home and personal use,5,If you're looking for good studio quality sound that can be used at home then these are perfect. They can still pump out quite loud but if you're looking for something that's going to be used for a studio then you'd want more than these
94,Crap,1,I just have no comment. Worse refurbished item I've ever had. Sloppy work.
95,Great for a small home studio setup.,5,"I use this set of monitors in a small home studio, making mainly electronic music. Crystal clear sound, and very neutral. If you need to make changes to the tonal response, there are a pair of controls on the back panel. Pretty unbeatable for the price."
96,Best sound,5,"Best sound,quality studio monitors"
97,Quality set of compact monitors,5,Sound quality is excellent considering the size and price. Would buy again in a heartbeat.
98,The best for it‚Äôs money! Solid sound!,5,"Best studio speakers if your on a budget.
Clear sound with good bass."
99,Great sound quality,5,They're perfect. Love them. Great quality.
100,Pretty Pretty Good.,4,Nice flat sound.
101,Absolutely awesome,5,These speakers are great for a small room. Super crisp and clear clarity. I couldn't be happier. The fact only one of them needs to be powered is a huge win over larger monitors. I paired them up with an Adam Sub7 and it feels like the perfect solution for a small space. The speakers on their own certainly lack the low end I was looking for - but if you are pairing them with a sub they work the mid/high frequencies extremely well!
102,Fantastic speakers,5,"Really good speakers for the price and size.

I run guitars through a Line 6 Helix, record using GarageBand, and stream music from my phone over Bluetooth.

Great, clear sound, surprisingly rich bass response.

Would buy again."
103,They are really good quality monitors!,5,"They are really good quality for the price, more than I expected. I really like it!"
104,Very good,5,Very nice top quality üëå
105,Amazing Sound!,5,"Bought for Bedroom DJ Setup, really clear sound and decent lower end if you use the bass volume on the back, I was on a strict budget and got these as 2nd option but im really glad I did, very happy."
106,proper,5,"amazing for fun studio or daily music listening, on Logic Pro x the bass is a bit weird ngl but on professional mixes and masters this is insane"
107,Excellent range,5,"Don‚Äôt forget to increase the lows at the back for those that like more bass (for those parties). Im hearing more instruments and sounds than in my previous speakers. Insane value for money - was contemplating the similar pioneers, but with Bluetooth included and still being cheaper these are a no brainer"
108,"Good value, but only for computer speakers",4,For the price point they are excellent computer speakers. I do not think they would be of sufficient sound quality for music production. If you‚Äôre looking for that maybe try the next model up at least and add another couple of hundred to your budget.
109,yes!,5,"These speakers were my 75th birthday present to myself. So many things are going downhill in the world today that it is to be noted and celebrated that affordable quality audio gets better and better. I'm listening to things I first listened to in the 50s, 60s and 70s and I'm hearing stuff that I never heard before. Good stuff such as a differentiation between separate instruments or voices which before were just blended together. I paid ¬£145 - worth every penny. Thanks Presonus."
110,Amazing price/quality ratio,5,"I wasn't expecting much for the price (although the glowing reviews hinted at some good potential), but these sound absolutely fantastic. I haven't tried them for mixing yet, but for general listening they compare very, very favourably to a pair of Rokits I had for a long time (bearing in mind the obvious difference in woofer size). They just sound clear, natural but still punchy. without any overbearing frequencies. Perhaps a bit tight overall, but I would expect that to mellow out as the cones"
111,Great desktop Speakers for a clear sparkling reproduction of music,5,"After MUCH deliberation I bought these for my office at work to listen to music at lower levels (and not so low when most of the workforce has gone home). I did quite a bit of research and there were quite a few recommendations for these. The next option level up I was considering were over double the price.

Overall Im very happy with them, They do lack a bit of low end, I find the AudioEngine A2's I have at some while smaller have quite a bit more punch and low end, however, they don't image n"
112,excellent,5,"a really nice pair of speakers, i use them for my main audio needs not just for pc"
113,stopped working after 4 days,1,"bought these a few days ago, sounded great, but now they don't make any sound , waste of money"
114,Love it!,5,This speakers are insane.
115,Good for music production on a budget or gaming or multimedia.,5,Well worth the price tag.
116,Brilliant speakers,5,"Good quality
Sturdy, robust
Easy to setup and use
Good design
Sounds fantastic"
117,"Don‚Äôt be put off by the size, these speakers sound great!",5,"Had to leave a set of Fluid monitors when I relocated from abroad and I wanted a small but powerful set of monitors. These definitely meet my requirements and are good for entertainment, music and for studio monitoring. Very happy with them."
118,Wicked little monitors,5,"The frequency range is great. There‚Äôs enough low end and the brightness isn‚Äôt too brittle. I had the M-Audio BM5s before and these are way better. Lovely and flat but with enough punch. Connectivity options are great too, just one plug socket needed! Crazy value for money"
119,Great on paper,3,"Had a hum on one of the units and had to return. Such a shame as, otherwise the sound quality was excellent. Build quality, however, is obviously suspect."
120,Excellent value,4,"Good quality at a budget price There will be better ones out there, but these are ideal for a budget studio set up. I'm not a gamer so I cannot comment for such applications."
121,"These speakers sound great, studio monitors",5,"I've had these for nearly a year and they've been used as day to day speakers for my iMac and also for mixing audio, I've found them to be really good especially for the price. From a musician who is always looking for the best quality sound I recommend these"
122,Clear sound. Great for mixing and listening.,5,Really great value and sound. I compared them with some mackie cr3 speakers. These where far clearer. I have used them only a short time for gaming and they sound very good because there is a high and low control on the speakers to tweek the sound. They also work great wth my behringer xenyx 1202usb mixer.
123,They sound amazing for the price tag.,5,I bought these monitors as I love the flat profile. As son as my teenage son listened to them that was it. I gave it to him and upgraded to a pair of KRK 5 gen 4. I highly recommend these speakers. They sound great via a DAC or even a record player.
124,Bass not very good,2,Ok so i took the plunge and thought ¬£100 should get me some decent pc speakers and after watching the you tube videos i was sure i was on to a winner. However if you want bass with your music then these are not the speakers for you. The overall sound was very tinny and to be honest the sound from old ¬£30 speakers was better
125,Pretty darn good.,4,"Very good deep bass of this little sub, I am the picky one and I've returned SUB's 3 times this little fella price. All thought is good for normal listening volume it lacks a little of power when you want to go wild and you want you neighbours to call for the police, but other than that I am fully pleased with the sub."
126,Best I've ever had,5,"It's truly amazing, I'm not an audiophile but i could hear the other speaker's low quality sound. This one is top notch. I can only recommend. Easy to setup, bluetooth works perfectly with my mac mini m1."
127,Very pure sound,4,"Early days but so far I am very impressed but with reservations. It appears that for a number of people they have stopped working within 2 years. Someone commented that there is a power chip with a heatsink that gets very hot which could be the cause. With this in mind I took out the 3 year insurance from Amazon, which knowing my luck probably means they will go wrong after that runs out. However, the pureness of the sound is excellent. For a number of years manufacturers have produced sound sys"
128,Probably the best speakers for less than ¬£100.,5,"I quite like these speakers. They are not your usual drowned mids/artificial bass boost bookshelf speakers., instead they are trying to be faithful to the source. I think they perform fairly well both for music listening and movies/videogames, while they still give you a lot of information if you want to do some music production. Not bad at all, considering they are as tiny as 3.5"" speakers can get, saving you a lot of space on your desk.

Apart from sounding great, they pack some nice features "
129,They do what i need them to,4,great sounding little monitors. perfect for home or small studio. but thats it! don't expect them to be loud enough for any other use.
130,Sound Quality,5,"I had to get them replaced as there was a buzzing sound the replacements were perfect, but the buzzing sound came from the speaker that plugs to electricity. Once that was unplugged buzzing went away leaving clear sound and loud and quality."
131,Nice quality sound,5,I bought this speakers to make some music production in i loved it
132,Great Pair of Speakers,5,"PreSonus Eris E4.5

Arrive in a nice box with a power lead, small jack to phono (which is typically what you need to connect them to a PC or portable device), and a length of speak wire to connect the two speakers together. I didn‚Äôt measure any of the leads but most of them are about 1.5m and the speaker wire is about 1.8m. The speaker wire is nothing special, no propitiatory plugs on the end, so easy to replace if you need something longer.

I bought these as a pair of computer speakers. Having"
133,Decent sounding speakers,5,"As per title, these are decent sounding speakers, they don‚Äôt have a huge volume output but loud enough for a house. Look good, easy to wire up & decent price, recommended."
134,Very pleased with speakers!,5,Very pleased with the bass and volume. Excellent purchase. I'm very happy. Having great fun with 5 year old nephew blasting the melodic techno
135,Great for home studio,5,Cristal clear sound with adjustable low and mid tones. Good sized speakers for home studio. Absolutely love them. Would highly recommend to anyone getting into home recording. Would like to have them a little bit louder but that is personal preference and either way you will not be disappointed with them. With the added bonus of studio one artist software which on its own is around ¬£80 to buy these are worth every penny.
136,Definitely adds oomph,5,Was skeptical whether this would complement my Eris E5s. But it definitely fills a gap in my bad acoustic home studio.
137,Amazing for the price!,5,"Some of the best speakers, amazing sound, and build quality. Would 100% recommend if you are in the market for some studio monitors"
138,Vast improvement on cheap PC speakers,5,"My Logitech Z506 5.1 PC sound system served me well for a decade but finally decided to stop working. As a temporary measure I set up the Dell PC speakers that had come with the system, and was shocked at how bad they were were! I was about to buy the Z607 speaker system, as being the nearest direct replacement to the Z506, when I spotted a recommendation on the Internet to try the PreSonus Eris E3.5 instead. I was a bit dubious about ""downgrading"" to just stereo speakers, but I had long stopped"
139,Good value,5,Tough speakers and compact. Good sound. I use for mixing audio and they give a good clear sound
140,Yeah ! Packing a Punch,5,"For the their size these speakers pack a punchy bass but the overall sound is rich and pleasing, vocals are clear and highs are detail crisp, I'm no HIFI expert but know when speakers for the intended purpose sound great and this pair are superb and do the job perfectly. Love them"
141,Best value monitor speaker,5,Best value monitor speaker! Had bought 3 monitor speakers in the past but this one really has a good sound quality than the branded one‚Äôs I had.
142,Great sounding,5,Compact great little speakers use them for gaming and sound design and they kick hard when you want them to.
143,VEEY GOOD,5,"Ideal monitor speakers for use in home recording for final mixdown. Also, useful as controls to use them with the pc for listening to music, and to play backing tracks to practise guitar to. Amazing sound for such a compact size."
144,Worth it for the money but no anti-thump on US style power switch.,5,"These speakers provide a clear, unmuddled sound stage. The frequency response seems reassuringly flat. Place on foam or similar to dampen vibrations which would otherwise skew the response. Loud enough for a 3x6m room."
145,"Good solid sound, well priced.",4,"Small, pack a punch and great value. I had to replace my 20 year old passive speakers for my little home studio.
These speakers give a good flat sound and are well worth the money. I use them in a room 2 by 2 metres for DJ ing and music making. They don't go super loud but for near field monitors that should not be needed or a problem. If you have a few extra quid go for the pioneers but if little me budget is tight, these are the boys for you."
146,Best quality for music!,5,"I use these amazing speakers for gaming, but specially for music, I produce music so that‚Äôs ve eh essential to have good speakers and for the price also I think this is the best around"
147,Decent quality speakers.,4,"Picked these up on Prime Day and they are a really decent quality speaker - ideal for turntables, computer or smart phone. Very good build quality, feel sturdy and sound great."
148,Solid performance,5,Fills the sonic gap I had with the 3.5 matching speakers. Cabling can be a bit tricky but i would recommend WBC (world's best cables) with the eminence connectors and classic xke quad mic cable. and buy longer than you think. A great sub would recommend the 3.5 presonus speakers as well
149,Great speaker but bluetooth is not being remembered,4,"I love the design, it looks neat and amazing. However, one issue the Bluetooth device is not being stored. After turning off the speaker then turn it on later during the day, my device cannot connect anymore. I need to ‚Äòpair‚Äô it again by pressing the button at the back of the speakers. Quite a hassle for me (thus 4 stars)."
150,More powerful than you‚Äôd think,5,"Standard monitors, good control and output, does not come with all cables, you will have to buy your own TRS cables"
151,Excellent!,5,"For the money these are probably the best monitors for the price. Presonus are a solid company and thier software is top notch!

If you aren't using Studio One you are missing out. Hands down the best DAW for a super price on the market. Love it."
152,Excellent value for money - audiophile review,5,"So I think these are the cheapest single bit of audio equipment I own. I wanted something to use at my desktop for monitoring my guitar playing without breaking the bank.

I have a ¬£600 hifi setup, good IEM's and open back headphones, and all things considered I think these are really good value for money.

Resolution (ability for them to reproduce detail in music)
- Good (for the money). You won't be able to discern lossy vs lossless music with these. Not even close. However they hold their own"
153,Excellent product,5,"Connect easily, sounds great, plenty of range"
154,Wow powerful,5,Did not expect it to be this big. Very powerful and clear bass with good tuning settings on the back. I wish it had a bass volume control on the back of the sub.
155,Blew Spectacular after 5 days!,1,"Worked fine for 4 days, switched them on the this morning instant loud band with a huge electrical spark seen through the speaker grill."
156,Singular Bluetooth Speaker,4,"I bought the 4.5 Bluetooth pair. While the sound quality is fantastic, something to note is that both speakers aren‚Äôt Bluetooth enabled. There is the main speaker, which is, and a passive speaker which you must connect cables to. More knowledgeable people might know to watch out for this, but I didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt compliment the sound enough, but had I known these were essentially wired too, I‚Äôd have found a more suitable pair that were both Bluetooth enabled."
157,Good monitors,5,"Price, sound quality, volume level. All good for me. Bluetooth an added bonus at this price"
158,Fantastic multimedia and gaming speakers,5,"I bought those to replace a set of Creative Gigaworks T40 II's and Creative T100's as I felt something was missing from the sound so I looked at those monitor speakers as they were discounted.

I'm not an audiophile but I do like good sound and these speakers have it in spades. As soon as I swapped my old speakers off my desk, I was amazed by how much clearer and well better defined the sound was.

Although I dabble a bit with a MIDI controller with virtual instruments sometimes, I'm not a music"
159,Utter bargain,5,"I recently got back in music creation and bought a DAW. Up until then I relied on headphones which were great. But then I read it's best to have a 2nd reference, ie audio monitors for checking levels and such.
Didn't want to spend too much in case It became another one of many fads.
I'm driving these with a PreSonus 24c audio interface, wired with singles TRS cables instead of the RCA cable they provide.
For the money they sound pretty darn good, and loud too. The pack a lot of punch for there s"
160,Great sound with an intense blue LED.,5,"Easily the best sound quality you'll find at this price point and for a speaker of this size. Great build quality, everything feels well made and solid, all the dials and connections are good. Only thing that sucks is the unnecessarily bright blue power LED on the front of them."
161,"Nice, Great speaker",5,"Small but mighty, (like me) Value for money, (also like me)"
162,Good value budget sub,4,"I wasn't expecting much from this device, as there is a good quality Adam Sub in my main studio that i've owned for 6+ years. This was purchased for my decks setup, and i have to say i am quite impressed.

Great value for money, and It fits nicely into an IKEA Kallax square, which is very convenient for hiding it away.

How could they improve it? put a volume control on the front"
163,They sound great,5,Very clear and balanced sound
164,What a surprise.,5,I didn't expect this. I wanted some smaller monitors for general use when I'm not running my full rig in the studio. These things gave me the biggest surprise for a long time. For the size and price they are stunning.
165,Awesome! General balanced sound!,5,
166,Superb audio for the size,5,Great clear audio for gain staging & mixing. And love the Bluetooth and multiple inputs. Very versatile.
167,Great speakers,5,Use them with my Sonifex SO2 to monitor the output - great sounding speakers.
168,Passive speaker not working,2,"I bought the speakers to use as a monitor for music production.
Unfortunately there was an issue with the left passive speaker.as I was unable to make it work.
I've been in contact with PreSonus Audio Electronics seeking for their technical support, but they couldn't resolve the issue.
Eventually I was advised to return the item to Amazon.
I'm currently waiting to be refunded"
169,Absolutely wonderful speakers highly recommended,5,Sound quality is excellent and set up in five minutes. Don‚Äôt hesitate‚Ä¶..superb bargain
170,Not Great,1,Sound quality way below what I expected. Weak bass and overall not a great sound. Disappointed!
171,Really great,5,"Spent weeks researching what monitors to buy and went through loads of different models. I was going to get the 3.5s but went for the 4.5 and I'm glad I did.

I use them for playing my guitar through amp sims, general music listening and watching videos and they're really very good. Cannot fault them at all. I haven't rated them in the review on the gaming side of it as I always use a headset for that."
172,"I cannot explain how good on every level these speakers are. Wow, sound, wow.",5,"Incredible, beats all other brands ive had pioneer, mackie etc etc. These things are crisp with a serious punch. From cello to funky house. Amazing."
173,Not ideal for loud sound production,2,"Unfortunately these didn't do the trick for me. Although the volume, bass and quality is actually really good, there is an issue where these speakers start distorting the sound once they have been in loud volume for more than 10-15 minutes, thus not being able to enjoy loud music.
It turns out that this is a common issue with these speakers, as suggested by other customers on other websites.
I have returned the item as it was not what I expected"
174,the sound is great,5,"these are great for the price, there are many monitor speakers out there and ive listen to a few different versions and these a really good quality, i would defo recommend them."
175,Excellent purchase for price,5,I have found nothing wrong with them. They're great
176,Incredible,5,"These are amazing, for the price alone, quality is great and so is the sound. Im glad i went for these

Get them"
177,Better than Expected,5,"I knew they would be good because of the reviews, however, I was sceptical because some people said they weren't as loud as the 4.5's. But since owning the 3.5 they are by far loud enough and I rarely use above half volume unless I want tinnitus. Only complaint is that I had to pay an extra ¬£17 for bluetooth when I feel that should come standard these days."
178,Great sound,5,Great sound- used with focusrite scarlet
179,Brilliant sub for the price,4,Brilliant sub for the price
180,Solid set of speakers,4,"Bought these to replace a set of Mackie CR4's which had started to give up after 6 years of light use - hoping these last a bit longer.

Easy set-up - the active speaker is the left one - which didn't work for me so had to reverse the inputs to make it the right one. Useful to have the power and volume adjustment on the front. Volume control very linear.

I am no expert but these do sound great, a step up form the Mackie's - I have zero hum and clarity is great up to the moderate volumes I liste"
181,Wow!,5,"I wasted 8 weeks! ... of thinking time deciding whether to buy these! They arrived today and I have hit them with everything, 3.5mm to RCA from MacbookPro, and Bluetooth from my iPhone. They sound breathtaking! Ignore any reviews saying they lack bass, they are really punchy. What they do deliver is a stunning stage of sound, great separation, and the type of depth that makes you think you're in the studio during the recording. Massively recommended!**** ... Update, I've just ordered the Eris 3."
182,Great sound at an affordable price,5,"Really nice speakers. I connected these speakers to a PC via an ifi dac, and the result was awesome.
Playing iTunes through Apple lossless, and the sound is crisp and clear. Nice bass tones as well, which doesn‚Äôt muddy the overall sound, or blow your eardrums apart.
Overall, a very nice sounding pair of speakers. Easy to connect, and very affordable."
183,10/10,5,10/10
184,"Clear sound, not booming or muddy at the bottom end like many speakers at this price",5,"I upgraded to these from some mid range Creative speakers- these sound much ckeaner. They're intended as near field monitors, so they're not designed to fill a room. But as computer speakers or for mixing, they're great"
185,Amazing speakers,5,"I read the reviews before purchasing these speakers to DJ at home. All the reviews said they were great speakers so I bought them and must say that for the price these are amazing speakers. Small, light and great sound quality. I would highly recommend these to anyone"
186,Very impressed,5,"These definitely surpassed my expectations. For the price i wasn't expecting such clarity and richness. It all sounds even, can't sense any boosting/dipping anywhere, pretty flat sound, definitely will do for mixing. I can't imagine better for the price."
187,Excellent sound quality.,5,So good I purchased another pair.
188,The best speakers which I ever had,5,"That are small but very powerful. The sound is so crispy that u can here every instrument in song which u listening. The games and films pushing you into armchair high, medium and low tones are perfect.

The best value for that money. Can recomend them to everyone who like to listening good music and playing games as well.

Best regards,
Rob"
189,NO CONTENDERS AT THIS PRICE POINT,5,Once these speakers break in they are truly astonishing (4.5 inch ) for mixing studio music as there is no colouration in the sound. What you hear is what other people will hear regardless of set up. FIRST CLASS.
190,Bluetooth connectivity is very poor,1,"The bluetooth connection from a PC does not work beyond 1 metre, I eventually maanged to scan and find the bluetooth from my PC but must be within that 1 metre range. It is ery difficult to scan, find and pair generally. This device requires constant pressing the pair button to re-establish a bluetooth connection. My android mobile connection works okay but the sound is very poor on certain songs with a base.

Very disappointing using the bluetooth and should not be allowed to be sold with this "
191,Good small monitors for music production,5,"I use these for a second, more portable production rig. You need to check lower bass frequencies on bigger monitors or decent headphones, but other than that 5 stars for price."
192,Great Speakers with a small problem,4,The sound from these little speakers are excellent but the Bluetooth part is really not great for 2022 it barely works just 3 meters away without cutting in and out. Disappointing on the Bluetooth. but purely for plugging in they are excellent.
193,"Presonus, Great as Always",5,"For ¬£150, the Eris Sub8 is great value for money. I'm a big fan of Presonus gear, and once again I am impressed. For me, one of the great things is the TRS connectivity, making it very easy to connect to your audio interface and your monitors. There are also numerous settings on the amp to tweak the sound to your liking. There is a bit of a noise floor, but it isn't too significant. I would definitely recommend this subwoofer to anyone looking for a budget option that still sounds great."
194,Not working,1,Product did not power up and was returned
195,"Great price point, great speakers",5,"I did my research before purchasing these. They have not disappointed. Have them attached to my record player, rock is crisp and clear, drum and bass is punchy, funk is....well funky. Overall recommend."
196,Fantastic sound quality!,5,"Used to use our old surround sound system with the turntable, but we got rid of it. These little speakers sound amazing! You still need your preamp with a turntable as there‚Äôs no phono input. Fabulous product for the money. Loads of bass!"
197,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!,5,"You wont regret buying these, So happy with my purchase. Spent all evening listening to how good they are."
198,Light and powerful.,5,Does exactly what it says on the box.
199,Excellent!,5,They arrived on time and work perfectly. Love them
200,Impressive,5,"Perfect for my pc set up and use with my DJ controller

Great sound from a small package"
201,PreSonus Eris Sub8 Compact with Gorgeous Looks & Average Performance!,4,"After all the positive reviews about this product, I was so much looking forward to hooking this Sub up to my system. However, I was at first very disappointed with the sound quality in general, because it did not deliver the window rattling, lound, punchy, low-end base like some other reviewers had suggested it did! Having said that, the addition of this Sub will actually drastically improve the overall low end frequencies when paired with the somewhat base-shy PreSonus E3.5 Satellite Speakers."
202,Good speakers for the price,4,"These look nice and are built well.

The cables are fairly long. Could be a little longer but long enough for most desks.

The volume can go very loud without losing too much quality. Louder than i will ever need.

These are meant more for music people who want to hear things more accurately. This means that for music production the are pretty good but some things and voices in practically sound a bit off.

They are okay for gaming as they have good bass and good sound quality although again, so"
203,Great connectivity,5,"I love the easy setup and form factor. The sound is great. I have them connected via line in to my mac and via blootooh to my my work laptop at the same time. The Bluetooth connection is instantaneous and always ready to start working away. No need to switch between sources.
I use the monitors for video editing."
204,Wan‚Äôt regret this purchase,5,"Amazing sound in small package, perfect for computer setups."
205,A real review,4,"If you would like a small compact yet powerful set of speakers to be used in a small room, these are really good. However, if you're after something with a bit more kick in a slightly larger room then you should probably go for the 4.5 inch version as the 3.5 inch version really lack bass. I love the 3.5 inch version of the speakers but it does lack volume, they don't go very loud so if you're recording at low volume in your DAW software playback will lack the volume that you so desire. The soun"
206,Outstanding for the price,5,"It‚Äôs been stated in other reviews that these speakers punch way above their price and size. I agree.

The sound from the speakers is big and open. The tweeters provide really great rendition on all sorts of cymbals and the set up picks up all guitars, pianos, violins and cellos, brass, reed and vocals and provides a remarkably authentic, clipping free level of fidelity for their price and size.

If they have a failing, it‚Äôs in low end bass. Anyone expecting too much of that from a 3.5‚Äù mid/bass,"
207,Great,5,Work absolutely perfectly and great sound quality
208,Used in my edit suite.,5,Work well and are built well. Sound quality good for the size. Recommend using foam isolation pads to improve desktop performance.
209,It‚Äôs a beast!,5,"Sounds great!

I‚Äôm using with the Presonus Eris 5s and the sound quality is excellent.

I‚Äôm literally running at a fraction of the sound it is capable of, but it really doesn‚Äôt need to go any higher. Crack this up and the bricks will stay falling out the walls!! :-)"
210,Broke within 6 weeks,3,"Real pity. Good sound but internal connections broke within 6 weeks. The speakers had not been moved since setup so I guess the internal electronics were poor. As I said, a real pity."
211,Really good for the price,5,Firstly I'll point out I get absolutely no mains hum from these whatsoever but studio monitors are sensitive to it. I had massive problems with my Adams caused by a duff mains adaptor. It'll usually be either from the leads or other devices plugged into same mains block. If possible give these they're own socket. Lamps can be trouble if in same socket. TV seems fine in same block. Upgrading interconnect cables also helps a lot. Mine are 50 quid and that's overkill but 20 or 30 should do. The sup
212,Good sound quality but bad QC,3,"I am using it with my Macbook Pro for general usage, listening to music, video, gaming. The sound quality is better than another M brand similar price speaker. But it did not turn on after a week. Have to replace another hardware."
213,I didnt know what I was missing,5,Got these for my PC and they blow all my old speakers out of the water. Loud and extremely high quality.
214,Delighted,3,"So much better than the Audioengine for use as PC speakers and at a third of the cost. Couldn‚Äôt be more happy so far.
Edit:
After three months use I know the product better now and have dropped two stars. My use case is for simple PC use: Youtube, the odd game, non-critical music listening etc‚Ä¶ Problem is that the stereo imaging is poor. You can often clearly notice distinct and separate sound out of the left and right channels. Perhaps that is how a monitor as opposed to a standard speaker is s"
215,Build and sound quality 5 star.,5,"I don't usually do reviews, for this product I will make and exception. Total value for money, build quality is superb, sound quality is amazing. Connected to my turntable and was blown away with the sound quality. Highly recommended."
216,Very Pleased,5,Great Product
217,Good sub,5,Best sub
218,Impressive.,5,Pretty impressed. Just received these and set them up using a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 as the interface and TRS cables from WORLDS BEST CABLES (Van Damme Tour Grade Classic XKE Starquad). Also an Anker USB-C to USB-C 643 Cable as I have spare USB-C outputs on my computer. You do get a standard USB-B to C cable with the device. I wanted something more than the usual computer speakers and think I have made the right decision. How can they sound this good and only cost ¬£87.
219,Lightweight build quality,4,"Bought from Amazon warehouse as none in stock at the time, I was disappointed to find no Instructions or software as advertised . More alarming was the lightweight build quality that has a hollow ring to it when you tap the cabinet. I was not expecting great things, but I was wrong (mostly)
There is plenty of power for nearfield monitoring and it digs deep keeping the notes tuneful and tight, no flabbiness at all. I was impressed! If only it didn't look and feel like a cheap imitation of the rea"
220,Music production,5,Great speakers. Flat response. Really pleased
221,"Impressive audio, no mains hum",5,"These are incredible. I used to own Yamaha HS8 monitors (¬£450) and these have comparable mid and high end. Lacking low end but that's just because the drivers are small so no complains there. Honestly if you need a pair of music/gaming/movie/producing speakers, get these.

I didn't experience any mains hum, even when plugged into a 10-way extended with 6 other devices connected. 10/10"
222,Great value for money.,5,"First pair I received had a fault (right hand channel wouldn‚Äôt work) but the replacements have been perfect.
Great sound, look good too."
223,The problem is strange frequency response,3,Weird frequency response. Good soundstage thanks to Good directivity. My advice is to consider something else but it‚Äôs not too bad if you can compensate using EQ based on measurements found online.
224,Perfect for My Digital Piano,5,Easy to set up with my powered monitor speakers. Looks good too.
225,Excellent with PreSonus Eris E5s,5,"I bought the Sub8 to go with a pair of PreSonus Eris E5s that I just bought. The sound of the E5s on their own was pretty impressive but with the Sub8, just brilliant. Easily as good as units costing way, way more. The Sub8 is great value at under ¬£200, very sturdily built, good control and connection options and sounds great. Highly recommended at the price."
226,Best value/quality small monitors I‚Äôve ever heard.,5,"They‚Äôre great, but don‚Äôt skip on the Bluetooth unless you really won‚Äôt use it. Has other mid and low knobs on the back, so they‚Äôre a little more versatile than just flat sounding when required."
227,Lovely speakers,5,"The speakers don't have any problem. It's rather my mistake that I bought it knowing that I have an amp, which this one already has internally. Good thing that I've only tested the left speaker as the right speaker has the amp - so connecting it to the amp I have would have killed it. I've bought passive speakers instead from a local shop. Thanks"
228,Happy with these speakers.,5,"I like these monitors, I believe I have made the right decision buying these little monkeys. Would've liked to see a visible marker on volume knob. Also needs L shaped power cable instead of straight. Took me 43 minutes to think of something to write here. You're extremely welcome."
229,Fill my need,5,I am very pleased with the result. (after a lot of dithering about what to order!)
230,Not sure how these have got such good reviews,2,"The sound quality on these is worse than my much smaller Bluetooth Bose speaker. They aren‚Äôt terrible so I‚Äôm keeping them but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend them, even for the cheap price."
231,great sound for price,5,"bought these to attach to record deck Great, fuss free connection, good sound and volume, bluetooth easy to set up and again good sound. having power switch and volume on the front is also good."
232,Good value for money,4,"Good looking and sounding studio monitors.
Good value for money.
Probably best bluetooth monitors for this price range.
I can hear the hum as many people describe but I guess I was lucky with my unit as it is very low and unnoticeable."
233,"Nice compact speaker, base kicks nicely",5,Nice little portable speakers. With some nice kicking bass. I use them on me decks and they've been fine. Only down side was it doesn't come with a rca to rca cable
234,Massive sound and excellent value - perfect for my home studio,5,These small and unassuming-looking speakers deliver amazing punchy sound quality and have a great selection of inputs. I use balanced TRS from my Behringer XR18 Air main outputs - the sound quality is superb and ticks every single box for my little home studio set up. I can't recommend them enough.
235,"PreSonus Eris E3.5, 3.5"", 2-way, High-Definition Multimedia Studio Monitors (Pair)",5,great set of monitors for hooking up a guitar or just playing music!
236,Great monitors for the price‚Äîplus excellent extra features,5,These sound great for smaller rooms plus they have the ability to adjust acoustics easily at the back. The bluetooth and front headphone jack features are excellent for the price.
237,Excellent speakers for gaming and watching,5,"I bought these as a replacement for some awful mackies speakers around the same price which had a soft buzzing whenever they were on.

These are excellent in comparison. They were easy to set up and sound great. No weird feedback at all. The quality is crisp and clear and being able to adjust the bass and treble a little is a nice bonus.

They‚Äôre pretty hefty on my small desk but look really nice and fit in with my minimalist pc set up really well.

Highly recommend these speakers!"
238,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,1,Very poor sound quality. Used with a turntable and certain albums very distorted. Tried plugging headphones into the speakers too and very poor volume. Very disappointed.
239,Love them.,5,Really good sounding speakers very loud and good bass on them.. Easy to set up love them I definitely recommend them
240,Unsure about sound quality,3,"I have these monitors (3.5"") mounted on a couple stands, plugged into a Steinberg UR22 via TRS.

The only other pair of monitors I've owned are the M-audio AV30. I seem to recall them having much more crisp sound quality than these, so I'm a little disappointed.
The sound comes across as a little muddy and heavy on the low-frequencies, without having the depth of sound of a larger box.

The stitching/joining around the centre part of my right speaker also looks pretty rough. Will upload a pictur"
241,Powerful sound,5,"Good sounds,easy to install value for the money"
242,Good sound quality,5,"I use them in my home music studio. Great combination of inputs, so you can listen to a combination of sound sources. Sound quality is crystal clear with a good balance of bass. Recommend these."
243,Very good sound from small speaker.,4,"Very good speakers. Neutral in sound, fast and strong bass, clear sopran. Surprisingly loud and muscular for its size. Unfortunately cables includes in the set is a garbage. Short, really cheap quality and broken in my set."
244,Packs a Punch,5,"So after doing lots of research and countless videos on budget monitor speakers it was a choice between these and a few other speakers within the same price range. I decided to purchase these speakers and i must say im very impressed! I wanted some speakers for music production and DJing but was a little apprehensive as i heard the bass on these are not as deep as the others and I am very much a person who loves my bass. These speakers pack a punch and carry a good bass, obviously you want get a"
245,Amazing speakers,5,"Fantastic speakers.

For such a small unit (3.5) I was surprised at the depth of sound from these little gems.

I'd originally bought acoustic pads for underneath but they come with small adhesive pads which do the job well and stand sturdy which means no movement when pressing the power switch.

Great speakers for a desk setup."
246,The speakers with that price and quality. Amazing!!!,5,Best budget speakers so far.
247,Big bass ...,5,So to start I would say this is a good speaker for the price and goes really well with the presonus monitors. I have after a lot of fiddling about got my set up so that the monitors sound like much bigger speaker while minising any bass traps in the room. It's very loud.. almost too loud so thr volume on this woofer is normally in the 2% range. Better for bigger empty spaces but I'm still glad I got it.
248,Great subwoofer,5,"Excellent subwoofer working together with Eris E3.5.
It's exactly what I expected for my home studio!
I recommend to all djs"
249,Clear and Bassy,5,"Sound quality is arguably one of the best for this price range, I turned to youtube for a review of these as I was split between these and M Audio speakers and the review showed that these had more bass and a clearer sound.
When they arrived and I plugged them in I was very impressed with the design and size (they're quite small) especially when I plugged them in and cranked them up a bit to find out they really do pack a punch and it's all clear no distortion.
I'm currently usimg them for gamin"
250,Great but works best with an equaliser...,4,"Out of the box, the speakers are pretty bass heavy and have a muffled low/mid sound. It left dialogue and footsteps feeling very muted but explosions and any music very dominant. The knobs on the back to adjust the treble and bass only do so much (not a lot).

However as I use them with a PC, applying an equaliser like Dolby Atoms, you can balance out the highs, mids and lows to get the best out of these speakers.

Once adjusted the speakers have the ability to produce clear highs and lows, albe"
251,the best budget sound monitors you can buy,5,it's the best budget sound monitor you can buy. before I move to the UK I had a pair of MS40 Behringer which was an amazing sound monitor. This one is much smaller than my old MS40 but it has kinda the same sound quality and it's lower than you need. don't buy its bigger version if not necessary.
252,Great little soeakers,5,Great little speaker for the price!
253,Blown away by these!,5,I saw a few reviews that mentioned a hum but I didn‚Äôt have that issue. Crystal clear sound via Bluetooth or patch leads to my helix floor. Exceptional for the price. Best Buy of 2021 and I do like my gadgets :)
254,Unusable due to missing cables and not being able to download the drivers,1,"Bought these from Amazon for a Christmas present for my son. However, on Christmas day he found the cables were missing. Contacted Amazon who offered a small discount so I could then purchase the missing cables which I bought from Amazon. These arrived today and he was able to set the speakers up to then find that he couldn't download the necessary drivers and software because when he tried to register the product they had previously been registered to someone else making them not fit for purpos"
255,Sound quality.,5,"For the price these little speakers are great value for the money. I have them connected to my Roberts bluetune 200 stereo system,and has opened up the sound and stereo audio. Highly recommended. R."
256,It‚Äôs what a small home studio requires,4,"As an EDM artist I like my tracks to have plenty of low end, and 3-7‚Äù monitor speakers fail to provide that deep sub bass reproduction, so a dedicated sub will always be needed to monitor them low frequencies, headphones get a part of the way there, but you will still miss valuable frequencies as true sub bass is felt instead of heard.
I‚Äôm very impressed with the impact of such a small unit, it drives them body blows of sub bass straight to your gut, and really fills that gap in my frequencies, "
257,Looks like more power,5,"Very nice sub, honestly i keep the volume at level 1, cause if go more is very loud, is looks way more powerful then 100w, impressed!!!"
258,Amazing,5,Amazing
259,Great speakers,5,I use them on vinyl with a pre amp. Really pleased with them
260,Shockingly Good Little Studio Monitors,5,"Oh my Goodness , when I sat down and plugged these puppies in for the first time. Put on a HD audio track. I was utterly amazed at the clarity. These are perfect for desktop speakers if you want to get away from the usual suspect pc speakers that are small and tinny and lack ooomfff. These definitely don't. Ideal for home Audio production, messing about on Ableton, Games sound great and obviously good quality tuneage like wavs and flacs will sound amazing when the speakers are used as designed w"
261,Great budget reference speakers,5,"Sounds great, I would recommend for home mixing, can go loud, very detailed, very good budget profiler.

Would not recommend for listening to youtube videos etc, as you can hear every detail and if someone hasnt mixed down their audio, you will hear the reverb in the room they are in."
262,A brilliant piece of kit.,5,"In my opinion, these have a Fantastic sound, Small footprint, excellent Bluetooth, adjustable bass and top end tone controls. Multiple input types and Bluetooth. Excellent value and highly recommended."
263,Slight modification made all the difference.,3,Since owning the sub I was always aware of a slight hum from the transformer. I tried a power conditioner that didn't make any difference. It will void the warranty as I did but I removed the amp from the back and found that the hum was coming from the transformer reveberating through the body of the sub. I ordered some M4 10mm x 15mm rubber mounts from amazon and mounted the transformer with them. I added a silicone tubing to hang under the transformer for added support. I thought I had done so
264,shakes the house,5,shakes the house üè° üëå
265,Great Speakers,5,Great Speakers very pleased.
266,Beautiful sound,5,I was really unsure what monitors to buy as my partner has been looking for some for his music. These sounds absolutely amazing and I highly recommend them!
267,Just brilliant audio.,5,"I already own a pair of harbeth dmp1 and dpm1 mini. Bought these for the new summerhouse, being active and Bluetooth was essential, being used mainly as projector soeaker and Android studio.

Whilst not up to the harbeth, I wasn't expecting them to be, but they are way better than expected. Details follow.

Stereo separation is perfect almost up to harbeth standard.

Clarity-unbelievably good, every instrument can be heard.

Bass- yes in spades, it's clear and unmuffled. Won't need to turn this "
268,Great value for the price,5,"Great product for the price, has a small form factor and does a good job. Headphone jack and Bluetooth connectivity.Volume control and on/off on the front!Easy to set-up ,you'll be up and running in no time. :)."
269,"stuff i need on the front, amazing sound.",5,brilliant...
270,What a powerful subwoofer!,5,"The sound can be as deep as that it described. What‚Äôs more, the powerful sound can be easily hear my neighbour."
271,Great,5,Great purchase would recommend is definitely worth the money and super easy to set up
272,They are very full ranged,5,"The only thing that could possibly be improved is the LED on the front, it is so small it is easy to overlook. I have left the speakers on a couple of times now whilst the system isn't in use . . not a good thing with electricity being so expensive at the moment. The sound is very good and the number of input options it handy to have. They are very good quality speakers."
273,Good for the size.,4,Smaller the the pictures before order. But slunds good.
274,Excellent sound quality,5,Partner used for mixing decks.He is impressed with the quality of sound.
275,Big sound from the size of it!!,5,Clear sound for home studio recording for my demos!!... but wouldn't recommend for major studio set ups.
276,Good Quality at a god price.,5,"Excellent value. Just what I need for my pc. Is better than the tinny base sound of many pc speakers.
Costs a bit more but is worth it."
277,Not lasted a year,2,"I'm afraid, these speakers have not lasted even a year yet. One of them has gone off suddenly and it appears I have not been able to get it started again."
278,Amazing budget monitors,5,"Never owned monitors before so I can only compare against regular speakers but these are amazing quality. I'm hearing sounds in my music I've never heard before.

I have them connected to a budget audio interface with balanced cables and I hear no unwanted noise.

They are also really nice to look at, the clean black boxes with the blue woven cones make this one of the nicest looking budget monitors, personally speaking of course.

I have listened to some 3"" mackies which sounded great but the s"
279,Cannot hype these enough,5,"I am shocked at how good these sound. I bought these as PC speakers, but hot damn they sound nearly as good as my HiFi speakers which are 20X the price.

I've plugged these directly into my soundcard, and they sound incredible, but will hopefully be even BETTER after I connect them to an external DAC. This these are a million times better than any Creative, logitech crap you can get for PCs."
280,Perfect,5,"No noise . No hum . Good sound and loud enough for mixing it up.
For the price . Great value . Would recommend no problem."
281,Amazing sound for a small pair of speakers,5,I already had some 5‚Äù speakers but they‚Äôre a little too large for my office desk hence why I went for these. For the price of these speakers I wasn‚Äôt expecting too much but I was blown away at how good they sound. There‚Äôs enough bass to feel it without being over powered and the mids and highs are very clear. Obviously these will not be ideal for a huge open area but for a small/mid size room you honestly don‚Äôt need any more.
282,"Perfect speakers, perfectly priced!",5,"Im really pleased with these speakers, so much that i am frustrated I pondered for a long time before purchasing.

Honestly, if you're after some active bookshelf speakers and your budget isnt the largest, then get these, dont hesitate!!! These are as good as or better than lots of the higher priced ones out there, that are passive and require an amp which can add up costs.

These look great, have a good weight to them and I think they're flawless hooked up to my turntable.

10/10"
283,"Good desktop speakers, but not true monitors",4,"Some of the reviews here suggest that Presonus have a quality control issue with the Eris 3.5. No such problems with mine, I'm happy to report. No hum, imperceptible hiss even with the volume turned right up, and both channels are equally loud.

Connected by unbalanced RCA cables to my Focusrite Scarlett 2i4, the sound is clear with as much bass as you'd expect from such small woofers and plenty of treble. The midrange is good with reasonable amounts of detail. When used as desk-mounted near-fie"
284,Studio monitors,5,"Great product superb sound only small but
Excellent quality"
285,Exceeded expectations,5,"I'm glad I didn't take notice of reviews that the sound quality is inferior and affected by humming. These are solid-state speakers (and come as a pair, not one as one bizarre review stated) and sound fantastic.

I heard instruments in Garage Band recordings I thought were a lot lower in the mix. But unless you have electrical grounding or wiring issues, you'll experience no humming and will find these to be exceptional value for money."
286,Truly amazing,5,"Premium. These are truly amazing speakers. All that is missing is a remote control. They have brilliant connectivity options, get very loud, very bassy and very deep and full sound.
Great for the price!"
287,Compact yet impressive,5,"I had been looking at these for awhile before I took the plunge - and I'm very glad I bought them!

For many years I had used the Bose Companion set of speakers with a small subwoofer connected to my PC. They were a bit overpriced but sounded great.

When the control unit packed up on them I was struggling to find a worthy replacement. Like another reviewer, I tried the Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II - they were awful! Not a very clear sound at all and no matter how I adjusted thyem they were "
288,Fantastic,5,Been using these for 3 weeks and the sound quality is fantastic. They did take a few hours to break in but the flat response on these monitors now are fantastic.
289,great job presonus,5,
290,Love them,5,For the price these are brilliant
291,Great sound quality but horrible hissing sound,2,Sounds amazing but has a hissing sound whenever it's turned on and it really hurts your ears.
292,Surprisingly good for audio,5,"I bought these in a rush as the power socket broke on my trusty (and very old) Roland MA-10s broke. In an ideal world I would have gone for the KRK ones to replace but I just don't have that kind of scratch right now and I really couldn't wait, I had stuff I needed to do and didn't want to waste even a single day. These arrived the next day which was really impressive.

At first when they arrived I was disappointed. They looked really cheap and plasticky and were nowhere near as solid as the (md"
293,Nice,5,Nice
294,Amazing,5,
295,Amazing,5,Absolutely astonishing sound for the money. Use mine in a home office and they‚Äôre a delight for all kinds of audio.
296,Excellent budget option.,5,Great for work at home boiadcast editors that want affirdable and reasonable quality monitors. Good enough for my BBC projects.
297,Brilliant speakers,5,The sound is reproduced so accurately with the PreSonus Eris E4.5 BT that I rarely use my monitor headphones. The Bluetooth system integrates seamlessly with my computer.
298,Be careful,2,"My rating is more about Amazon than the monitors. I purchased a pair of these from Amazon as they are advertised as ""High Definition"" studio monitors and when i received the item, it was the inferior model that was not high definition. The Hi-Def model clearly states on the box that it is a hi-def edition.
I of course returned the item unopened."
299,Wow are the cases resonant,2,"I've had my pair of E3.5's for about 3 hours as of writing this review. They sound pretty good now.

But to my ears, they didn't before tinkering...

The cases are 1/4"" MDF, sound very resonant when knocked, and could be felt to move due to bass notes. This colours the sound quite a bit with a sort of boxy boomy nonsense going in the upper bass/lower male voice region.

To cure them, opened them up and added sound-deadening mat to the walls as well as a few small cross braces. Fun opening the ri"
300,Pleasantly surprised,5,"I needed a small studio monitor that I could connect my Bluetooth devices, my TV and my desktop computer. This does all 3. It is an amazing device. Easy to set up. The Bluetooth is excellent. The sound quality is just so amazing. I would not recommend for a large space, my place is a 1 bed apartment so the volume is amazing for my place but for a house it will look tiny. I would highly recommend to anyone. The hisss sound only happens when you have an input plugged in, it does not happen on Blue"

304,Static sound.,1,Static sound from speakers. Tried multiple wires and it changed nothing. Common problem it seems.
305,Decent quality for the money,5,useful for general music and also I use them as home studio speakers - pick up most frequencies pretty well
306,Awesome,5,Awesome
307,Best desktop speakers I have had,5,"I use it as my desktop speakers on Bluetooth mode. Very easy to pair up. And can adjust treble and bass so can tune it to your preference. For the price, I am very happy."
308,".....for the money they are amazing. I'll try that again, 'they are amazing'.",5,"Have been trying to get decent PC speakers for ages, have managed to get decent headphones (AKG K612 Pro), but never decent speakers. The last set I ""upgraded"" to were Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II (2.0), and they were ""ok"", and not cheap. I guess I should have dropped the idea of ""PC speakers"" long ago.

So, after putting up with the ""ok"" Creative Labs effort (don't get me started on the EU power saving garbage), and getting into the habit of perma-wearing headphones. I finally decided to ch"

310,Honestly one of my best purchases of the year,5,"These turned up and I was overwhelmed by the sound quality and accuracy, volume and punchiness of the sound was exactly as expected and for my use in a room about 3x3m they are above and beyond anything else I have tried.
For audio mixing an add in sub would definitely help fill in the lows that these cannot reach but for any hobby listening or as pc speakers as I have them they are more than enough and at a fantastic price point"

317,Excellent Sound,5,"I work in broadcast - Post Production. These speakers are excellent for the price. I've purchased for my work from home kit. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these speakers and the multiple of hundreds of pounds speakers at my work.

Speakers come with phono to 3.5mm jack and 3.5mm to 3.5mm cables."
318,Mmmm or should that be Hummm?,4,"Overall a pretty accurate sound with no peaks, so great budget monitor PC Speakers.....except for the hum. The humming can be heard when playing quiet music. I have got used to it and play music a bit louder which seems to cover the hum as it stays at the same low volume."
319,"NOT a Studio Monitor or anywhere close, but . . .",4,"These are pretty good speakers for the money. But they are not in anyway shape or form ""studio monitors"" - that is just preposterous marketing hype and Presonus should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, not least because they know perfectly well how to make studio grade gear. These are not that.

My concern is for people thinking they can realistically spend less than a hundred quid and get the kind of flat uncoloured sound a real studio monitor would deliver, but to get that, you're realistic"
320,These are great monitors.,5,"I love the Eris 3.5‚Äôs, I already own the Eris E5‚Äôs and wanted monitors that would compliment them, I also added the Presonus Sub 8 subwoofer and routed them all through my Presonus Monitor Station V2. I am thrilled at the clarity and depth this set up gives me. We record & mix vocal tracks and needed to hear the various frequencies clearly, this has been achieved. I highly recommend this product.

321,1 happy teenager,5,Sound incredible
322,Great sound quality for the price,5,For how much it costs the sound quality is great and it also comes with Studio One which is a DAW you can get when you register the speakers
323,Excellent Stereo Image,5,"I didn‚Äôt expect much, but once plugged in I was amazed how good the sound is. The stereo image is excellent with a wide sweet spot, and even with limited space and the monitors both in a corner, with the eq adjustment, they perform perfectly for my needs. All in all, a well made product at a great price and excellent sound quality."
324,sounds pretty good,4,"using those while producing sound for film and video and so far so good, happy with the purchase"
325,Sounds amazing,4,"These are small speakers but they sound so good! Totally worth the money. They are my very first speakers, I love them. I recommend it guys."

327,Great,5,Perfect for my small home set up. I only make demos and record/ mix / master elsewhere so these are perfect.

329,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,If anyone‚Äôs struggling to decide what speakers to get themselves and are a bedroom production artist then these are the best budget speakers and definitely worth the extra money for the 4.5s vs. the 3.5s!
330,Excellent,5,Excellent
331,Great sound and value. Don‚Äôt worry about hiss or hum.,5,"I was a bit worried about purchasing these as there are quite a few reviews complaining about mains hum and hiss. I can report that you can hear a hiss only if you put your ear up to the speaker, that you will get with all active speakers, you get a mild buzzing sound from the left one when you are connected with Bluetooth. These are both very minor and nothing to worry about (I am very fussy). The majority of bad reviews I think are relating to the older version of these. Presonus seem to have "
332,Top class,5,Sound is perfect and better than I imagined. Used on my synth and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality of these speakers. Good value for money
333,Good quality product,5,"All positives for this amazing product, warm sound quality for this decent sized cone and ample for my requirements for music production. Have tested playing back a CD, the sound quality is rich. Totally satisfied."
334,Excellent Speakers,5,"For the money you pay to get these speakers, I'm blown away by just how good they are.

Build quality

Well built and feel high quality. They also look great. Can't complain

Set up

Set up was a breeze. Plugged them into my audio interface and a power outlet on my wall and they were good to go.

Sound quality

Sound quality is amazing for what you pay. It's clear and doesn't break up on high volumes. These are great for gaming, music production, video production and casual listening to music.

335,Bass Response is nonexistent,3,"I like these speakers for mixing- I have a small setup (laptop, keyboard controller and the speakers). They give you a really good idea of balancing levels BUT- it's really difficult to balance bass instruments as there is virtually no bass response. I have to switch to headphones to do that. Trying to eq a bass instrument is very difficult on these speakers. If they had a better bass response then I would give 10/10 for this product. The mid, treble and stereo image are very accurate though. I'"

338,"Sounds great, bluetooth a real plus",4,"The sound is great so far. Using as monitors for mixing home recordings and also for listening to music. The Bluetooth connection is really handy as means I can play music from different devices without having to plug in. Good value overall, would highly recommend for home use."
339,"Great sound, poor legacy bluetooth connectivity",3,"Despite the cheap feeling plastic case these actually produce a very pleasing sound. Deep and detailed enough for use on a desk for sure.

Bluetooth paired up instantly with 2021 MacBook Air and played flawlessly. However, I bought them to sit either side of a 2012 iMac running OS 10.11.6. Forget it. Spotify refused to accept there was anything to play through, and any native Mac sound source was stuttering and distorted.

341,Excellent sounds from such compact units,5,"I was surprised by the quality of sounds from such compact units. I have bought similar units in the past & been slightly disappointed by both the build & sound quality, but not in this case. The Presonus units feel solidly built & the quality of sound from such compact units is excellent. I dabble in music making so being able to hear subtle differences in timbre from different instruments is important & these speakers deliver. I like the option of the headphone jack on the front for those occa"

350,25 mins and ka-bloey!! Replacements working but reliability concerns remain.,3,"Got this item today. Sounded good for all of 25 mins when connected via a line in playing music. Then buzz, crackle, flash and dead. My assumption is the amp in the left unit has shorted. Amazon have been really good and I've risked ordering a replacement. Will see what that one is like but at the moment am not impressed.

352,Excellent for the price!,5,"I use it for music production and I am very happy with the price and quality.
High and low frequencies are well distinguishable. The volume is more than enough. Highly recommend!"
353,Very impressed,5,Wow I never thought these speakers would sound as good as people say they would but I just installed them and im blown away at the sound quality and loudness Excellent choice for anyone that enjoys music and media. 10 out of 10
354,Amazing sound and value,5,"Great speakers and amazing value for money. Don't hesitate in buying, you will not be disappointed."
355,These have no right to be so small and sound so good.,5,"Now, I've heard expensive speaker, nautilus and the like. I regularly DJ with top end QSC's.

These are much cheaper, much lighter and have no right to sound so damn good!

Whether it's a bit of The Week-end and blinding lights, or Ludovico Einaudi and Nuvole Bianche, these speakers punch far far above their weight for the price.

In short, get them for small room listening or as a great set of monitors for home DJ'ing."
356,Great.,5,Absolutely love these. Perfect for a small home studio.
357,Great crystal clear studio monitors.,5,"Full sound spectrum flat rezone monitors, ideal for studio work."
358,"Great value studio monitors, ideal for small home studio",5,"Good quality little studio monitors for my spare bedroom/studio

Sadly don't make me sound any better as a musician but that's more my fault than thiers"
359,Really like them,5,Well worth the money I paid for them. Excellent product.
360,Meet expectations of all the great reviews,5,These are quality speakers for near field monitors. Had to go with this size due to space but they totally exceed expectations - as good as the reviews say. Some say bass is missing but you can adjust on the back of the amplified speaker.
361,Fine for desktop use,4,"Bought these for desktop use for a home office where I wanted a some decent speakers for the endless Zoom calls!. They are nice and clear, however I have to say they are a little boomy at the 120Hz range, so voices can resonate at that annoying frequency. Ive ended up turning the 'low' EQ dial right down to counteract it. Having said that they're nice bright, so speech is clear. Music sounds OK, though you wouldnt really get these if that was your primary use for them. These are nice compact uni"
362,Cheap and good,5,"Being tight for space I bought these as monitors for music production and voiceover/podcast work. Whilst clearly not the most powerful speakers they are clear and have decent output, and allows fit good tone control via the pits on the back. Balanced RCA inputs are another bonus given the price point. The connecting wire between the speakers is very thin and cheap but this is an easy upgrade. Overall I am very pleased."
363,Ideal for home studio,5,Just the job for my home recording set up.
364,Excellent mid price monitors.,5,"Okay, I'll be honest here, these 4.5"" are my first pair of studio monitors so my remarks need to be taken in that context.

In short, I like them, I went through loads of reviews and canvassed quite a few experienced home studio owners and these speakers were generally well regarded, as were their' smaller siblings the ERIS 3.5"". In use, I find them really good, they are certainly loud enough to be heard and articulate enough so that you can hear every nuance of sound. To date and taking my lack"
365,Great value for money,5,"Speakers were delivered promptly (although just left outside outside my house where anybody could have taken them).

That being said for someone like myself who's only recently decided to invest more in music production, I must say the sound quality, build quality and overall value for money are all excellent and I'd recommend these speakers to anyone."
366,Compact size good sound,5,Nice and compact for the small area going into. Probably not the best for critical listening but I just needed something to give my ears a rest from headphones when just putting radio show together. Good for the price and seem well made.
367,Great for the price.,4,"Overall good monitors, think I've just been unlucky and received a set with a dodgy on/off switch."
368,Great product,5,These speakers in analogue mode are the best sounding speakers on the market. Whether it be 78 rpm 45 rpm 33 rpm or cd rips. They are exceptional in digital mode.
369,Awesome,5,"Quite nice, expected bigger monitor but they're fine for producing beats and music in general. Also for some mixing work they're the best for this price"
370,Sound great hooked up to pc.,5,"Hooked them up to my pc after discovering my Samsung monitor didn't have speakers!
Sound fantastic and plenty of bass to them.
Would love a redesign of the volume knob as it's a little too small and recessed for ease of adjustment."
371,All this for ¬£80.. And some folks aren't happy??,5,"Although I've only used them for a couple of hours, they've blown me away for the clarity and detail these little speakers give. Versatile, fun, easy to connect to a variety of sources. Perfect for the small studio or for adding some oomph to gaming or listening to music in a small room. Just buy them. Really! You can thank me later."
372,My experience with these speakers,5,"Awesome set of speakers, before I bought it, I did a good bit of reading reviews, googling & checking out YouTube. I had my concerns of course, but thankfully these speakers met my needs and there is no hum or white noises from them for me and I enjoy the sound quality delivered by the speakers, even the bass sounds rich & amazing to me. I have my TV & Pc via a sound card hooked upto these speakers. Only thing I wish is that there was a sleep/timer power off mode for these speakers for those tim"
373,Accurate on the highs not so on the bass,4,"These are pretty good at this price.

They are particularly accurate and detailed in the high frequencies with good stereo definition. The bass is a different matter, however, revealing a very distinctive frequency bump at 150hz...so it'll sound artificially 'boomy' without the subs (obviously not much sub-100hz given the small size of the speakers). Rolling off the bass on the controls helps a little bit but the 150hz peak remains.

Used for mixing, I think these are good for a three-four hour "
374,"Great price, great sound",5,You won't get better and more versatile speakers for anywhere near this price
375,Best budget studio monitors ever!!!!,5,Absolutely crazy sound on these no matter the input everyone else's reviews are lying if they say it's bad because I hear no hum at all there crisp even if you do nothing with the tone or the bass the sound is still very clear and crisp.
376,Fit for purpose,5,Works great!!
377,Good buy,4,"Good buy, good sound for basic speakers good for playback and monitoring, feedback minimal"
378,Just about average,3,"Using with the presonus audiobox 96, sound is of average standard, speakers are smaller than expected."
379,Used for digital synthesizer,4,"Not using for gaming, so adapter was wrong size. Correct one now fitted, sound clear and ok, nice size speakers, came well wrapped, but polystyrene which I dislike. Other than that, great speakers."
380,Really good for money,5,Great all round
381,Happy,4,"For the price good small active speakers, reasonable sound reproduction"
382,Superb speaker great value for money,5,Bought these to use with my Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and my MacBook for monitoring music recording. I am delighted with the sound quality. I saw mention of hum or sound interference. I have to say that this is not an issue for me. I think these speakers are incredible value for money.
383,Excellent small studio speakers,5,Really excellent little speakers. Good sound quality. The volume and headphone input on the front are particularly useful. Exactly what I needed for my small home studio and they did n‚Äôt break the bank !! Very pleased with them üëç
384,Great studio monitors,5,Great clarity and quality
385,The best speakers I have ever owned,5,
386,Outstanding for the price.,5,"Presonus really show off why they are the last word in professional audio with these speakers.

The audio from these speakers is sharp and accurate, all the way down the the advertised 30Hz cutoff. Yet despite this they still provide a comfortable listening experience when being used for non professional tasks.

The speakers are able to push an impressive volume for there small size, however they are still monitors, don't expect them to fill a large room with sound. The amplifier's are very quie"
387,Worth every penny,5,Great sounding speaker for the price
388,Can't go wrong with thease,3,Surprisingly Lound for the size easy to pair with bloototh.comes with all sort of cables u need and u get entry level Studio one 5 software if u getting thease for monitoring your records u won't be decapitated for the price
389,Great quality sound for the price and size,5,"I bought these to replace some active computer speakers that had stopped working and to help me with a recording project. For the price pont on the size of the speakers (3.5 inch main speaker cone), they deliver excellent sound quality with very good clarity and separation. Perfect for the job."
390,Superb sound system,4,Superb! High sound clarity. Value for money!!!
391,"For something so small, they fill your room with quality sound.",5,"Presonus fits really well in my bedroom. I‚Äôve fitted them either side of my chimney breast for true stereo and they sound amazing even without a subwoofer.

I highly recommend them."
392,Great little speakers,5,"I've had these about 3 weeks and pleased with then. I bought them to use with my laptop running cubase, and for gaming and for the family to use. I use them wired when using cubase as the audio comes out via a steinberg ur242 usb audio interface and so use phono leads to take the audio from the ur242. When gaming I use them via bluetooth and the family have paired their phones so they can play their tunes. The speakers were playing within 2 minutes of unboxing, no issues at all. It's handy havin"
393,Great value,5,Excellent so far - very good even at low volume
394,Small but pack a punch.,5,"Very clear sounding monitors for the money. They are really small, but pack a punch for their size. You will need stands to get it to the right level for your ears. I also own the KRKs which a lot more than expensive to buy buying just one monitors. You can't go wrong with these, I would recommend the 4.5 if your have large room."
395,Nice pair,5,"I‚Äôm no sound engineer, but these are a great pair of studio monitors. Good sound quality, clear and crisp. They do the job when it comes to music production and are great value for money."
396,Excellent speakers,5,I play my electric guitars through these and I am impressed on the pure sound. Although they are small they can pack a punch without distorting. Would highly recommend
397,Great Value For Money,5,"Pros
Beautiful compact design.
Reproduces sound accurately.
Larger than average tweeter and woofer.
Low price.
Durable enough for constant daily production use.

Cons
If you use the unbalanced RCA jacks, the sound is better when also using an audio interface.
To get a heavier bass sound, you need to add a subwoofer."
398,Brilliant sound,5,"For the money, these are fantastic and will be ordering another post for downstairs."
399,Great value,5,"Great sound quality, great value"
400,Great little speakers for the money,5,"Excellent speakers for the money, Lovely detailing. Ideal for home studio.
These are not designed for heavy bass, but that's the point, there more designed for detailing your mix. Don't get me wrong, they have enough bass response to work with though.
Highly recommended...."
401,Great sound,5,"for the cost I was a little dubious, but these speakers, which are hooked up to the turntable in my study sound great and have transformed my pleasure of listening to my vinyl while I work."
402,WOW,5,"My first set of ""studio monitors"" and WOW the quality, volume, bass are all just incredible! No matter what volume you use these at (though honestly anything over half id deafening!) they sound so clear and crisp. Worth every penny!"
403,Uncontrolled Bass,3,"I don‚Äôt normally review anything but thought it would help others. I used to work in the Hi Fi industry running a hi fi shop for many years and have a very nice setup in my lounge, so know a thing or two about Audio

Having looked online at many reviews you often purchase on the many recommendations, this is never a good idea but perhaps sometimes necessary, So I purchased the PreSonus Eris E3.5 and set them up and ran them in.
I was presented with a sound that is so uncontrolled in the low freq"
404,"sound great, look great for the price",5,It's hard to beat these for the price. Sit them on some isolation foam pads and they are even better. Work well for amateur music producing and mixing. Small but effective monitors.
405,Good sound cheap for music producer,5,Cheap and good sound for the price
406,Excellent Addition to my home studio,5,"Recommended by someone who knows speakers , for less than ¬£90 I am delighted by the sound and build."
407,Good,5,"Use these to monitor my Yamaha MX88 keyboard for home use. Just right but if you want LOUD then these will not be suitable. Not really loud enough to monitor recording from a DAW.
They do what they say on the tin and excellent value for the money"
408,Great sound quality,5,Great product
409,Good for music production,5,Good for the price for music production so far so good
410,Very good speakers,5,"Working great for playing music and gaming on my desk, and they aren't that large which is ideal for the location I had to place them."
411,great speakers at a great price,5,"I bought these speakers for my son, and we already have single popular braded speakers at a similar price but needed to have the facility to hear the music differently . I was really impressed by the depth of the base and the qukaity of sound that when compared with our current speaker there was no distortion nor tinny effect., Were really happy with these . To note all of us will have certain sound preferences and experience sound differently"
412,Good quality,5,sounds so good with my sarato decks
413,Fantastic,5,"speakers are amazing, look amazing, sound amazing but you need some accoustic foam if you live above any one else or dont want the sound to travel... over all the speakers are amazing for the price."
414,"PreSonus Eris E3.5 - 2-way, High-Definition Active Studio Monitors (Pair)",5,"PreSonus Eris E3.5 - 2-way, High-Definition Active Studio Monitors (Pair) Better speakers quality for music studio I am using for and so good for ambient nature sound background effects, gaming and movies... No problems with the speakers and the bass and treble absolutely brilliant."
415,Worth every penny,5,I use these in place of my guitar amp and run my helix pedal into them direct and the sound is amazing
416,Great value studio monitors!,5,I don‚Äôt normally review items but I‚Äôm so impressed with the clarity of these speakers that I thought it would be worth a mention. The sound is clear at low and high volumes and I‚Äôve had zero buzz from them too.
417,Brilliant sound quality,5,"Didn't expect much to be honest but wow I was blown away by the sound quality was in 2 mind which size 3.5 or 4.5 went for the bigger option as you do but should have went smaller knowing now how decent these sound (No regrets though). The sound out performs my surround sound which cost 5x as much.
Would recommend to any one wanting some decent sound for affordable price. I do get some sound distortion from the cables bit annoying. still worth it"
418,Did not work.,1,"These did not power on for me at all, even with a different (working) cable. Exchanged for JBLS."
419,Arrived today and was happy but a big problem on testing,2,"All in all they sound good , clean sound , but unfortunately there was a problem with the tweeter on the main unit , vibrated at certain frequencies , so packed them up again and will return , will buy something else as QC on these speakers seem to be a problem and a lot of people have problems with them , I did not get the dreaded hum but a lot vibration noise , very disappointed had great hope for these."
420,( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞),5,These speakers are pretty good.
421,Time to eat humble pie! These are amazing!,5,I bought a pair of these monitors from a company who turns out to have their warehouses based in the Netherlands. I will send an email informing me that the delivery would be some weeks later which rather surprised me. In the end they arrived in about 4 days and to say they are good is an understatement. They have resources like videos explaining ideal set ups and I think I take a bit of listening to bed-in but the sound is incredible - I say for such a small set of speakers but actually they ju
422,"Absolutely shocking, not worth the money",1,Speakers stopped working within a couple of weeks of setting them up
423,Super sound quality for my pc workspace and for electronic music production,5,Along with many others - I am currently working from home (almost a year now!) - and I got these speakers to connect to my pc so I can listen to music while I work making my workspace more habitable. The sound quality is superb - even over blue-tooth - and a huge upgrade from my previous speaker (JBL Charge 2 blue-tooth) - I also got some stands so they are at head height which does make a difference for these 'monitor' speakers. I am also getting back into creating electronic music and these ar
424,Exellent Sound Quality and Sturdy Construction,5,"They feel like a premium product at an entry level price.
I love the choice of inputs on the back and have 2 different sources connected to them.
They give a crisp clear sound and I am very happy.
Would recommend.
10/10"
425,Amazing value,5,Great sound quality and good stone volume will fill a big room. Great for the price better then some more expensive speakers/monitors I‚Äôve owned
426,"Superb, and not just for the price",5,"Amazin sound quality and volume.
My harman/kardon go+play have just broken down: both of the drivers' cones torn after 8 years of mild use - disappointing right?
The Presonus E3.5 pair beats the harman/kardon easily.
I hooked it up with my PC and my Amazon Echo. Works like a dream. No humming, buzzing white noise, just the purest, clearest sound I have ever experienced from such a little pair.
You just can't go wrong with them"
427,Great value,5,"Excellent monitors great value, using with presonus 24c sounds really good,"
428,Amazing!,5,Amazing sound quality and excellent value.
429,Great quality,5,"I took ages to decide on a pair of monitors. I have Presonus USB interface for recording on my PC so after reading reviews i decided on these. Very glad i did they are wonderful. Good for listening to Spotify and revealing enough for mixing and recording. They fir nicely on my desk either side of my Dell LCD screen and fill the room perfectly, no distortion just clarity. I added an old sub woofer via a splitter and use if i want more bass, but to be honest they don't really need it for most genr"
430,PreSonus Eris E4.5,5,"Awesome monitors. Using them for my audiotechnica turntable , laptop and phone, sound quality is excellent and plenty loud enough for where I‚Äôm using them"
431,Avoid,1,"The actual speaker sound is top quality, Amazon shipped me a replacement as the first one I got made loud white noise even when volume down and using Bluetooth made a loud hum. Second one just arrived and exactly the same, avoid."
432,Turn them up loud,5,Great for home music studios bass response is amazing
433,Great Speaker that fell short,3,"I have had the product for a year now and the quality of the speakers has dropped drastically. When using them in a party within 2 hours the speakers volume starts dropping, not sure wether they overheat but they dont handle it well. Sadly i will need to purchase new speakers after just 12 months."
434,Speakers save Lockdown,5,Honestly the best purchase I have made since lockdown. I am talking bout the first one not the trilogy series
435,Expensive sound quality at a bargain price.,5,"Great price for such amazing sound, beautiful tight bass and super clear treble, look the part too with the blue light, only minor gripe would be that the volume knob doesn't stick out enough and it's very sensitive, one slight turn and the volume booms up, easy enough once you get used to it though, highly recommended."
436,Mine were faulty,2,The right speaker on mine was faulty /muffled right out of the box.. All avenues for fixing it didn't work. Amazon couldn't send a replacement either
437,Fantastic sound quality for the price,5,"I've had these connected to my PC sound blaster for quite some time now. The sound quality is extremely good for the size of speaker and the price point.

Nice robust design so they're able to take the accidental knock or two.

The aux and headphone sockets are a handy addition.

Very good product for its price."
438,impressed,1,"crisp and flat sound, excellent separation, quite powerful.
only downside is there is no indication to the volume control and the power on blue LED can be a bit distracting/bright.
very impressed

edit
speakers have developed a very audible hiss.
I either missed that yesterday when I was too busy playing different genres of music to see how they sound or they just developed it after a few hours of use.
Unacceptable, will be returning them"
439,Recommended,5,Perfect sound and quality. I use them to play music and production and they are perfect.
440,Exceptional for the price,5,"I'm absolutely blown away by the quality of these tiny monitors. Exceptional, staging is excellent, quality fantastic. Super impressed!"
441,Great budget speakers,4,"I already own the E4.5s and wanted to downsize to get more space on my desk. My thoughts purchasing the E3.5BT was that they'll have a similar, if not the same sound profile as the E4.5s. How wrong I was.

The sound on the E3.5BT is thinner, lacking significantly in the mid-range. The highs are excellent due to the 1 inch tweeter found in both versions. The lows are excellent as well, but not as punchy as the E4.5s.

The build quality of both speakers is phenomenal for the price. Don't think you"
442,Would recommend,5,Would definitely recommend (especially for the price)!!!!
443,Impressive - once setup properly but bluetooth could be better,4,"When I first got these speakers, I really didn't like them.
1. The bass was boomy making the low and mid all a bit 'muddy'. Checking on the Presonus FAQs it is recommended to keep the speakers away from the walls by 4 feet (1.5ft mentioned elsewhere) because of the rear port, so I pulled them forward and the boomy muddyness had gone, delivering a balanced sound with detail and punch. I was thinking of adding a subwoofer but I'm not going to bother - I like the sound as is (obviously these speake"
444,Good affordable speakers.,5,"Use these with my keyboard for practice, very good sound."
445,Great for the price,5,I‚Äôm using these in my home studio and they work very well for the price.
446,Excellent home studio monitors,5,"Bought these to upgrade my home studio. As you can see my entire kit is presonus. I love the flat sound of these, they are plenty loud for a home studio with enough bass response and superb balance across the frequency range.
The volume knob on the front of the LHS speaker I haven‚Äôt used as I control the volume from my presonus iTwo interface."
447,Best studio monitors,5,Honestly best studio monitors I could have purchased I HIGHLY recommend!!!
448,quality sound,5,Great speakers bit expensive .
449,Great Speakers,5,Use these as Monitors for a Denon MXC8000 and they compare equal or better to speakers costing ¬£400 or more very impressive clean sound no distortion or hum.
450,Excellent speakers,5,Excellent speakers highly recommend
451,Good,5,Very good
452,Pleasantly Surprised!,5,"I was looking for a cheap pair of monitors for my room recording set up and came across these and let me tell you, they are absolutely amazing for their value DON‚ÄôT LET THE LOW PRICE TAG DISCOURAGE YOU. I‚Äôve been using these for a few months now and they provide a a great sound quality for mixing as well as everyday use and gaming. They are quite small but are quite powerful and extremely easy to use. If you‚Äôre looking to build a studio or casually looking for a pair of monitors on a budget don‚Äô"

454,Great set of speakers for Near Field testing,5,"Small, compact, great value."
455,Poor power supply,2,"I've had two pairs of these speakers, the first pair failed to turn on after their third day of use.

I returned that pair with no trouble and opted for a replacement - I'll always give a second chance.

The second pair had an audible hum - very unlikely to be a ground loop, it was on the same outlet as the source and i tried others - it wasn't a loud hum and may be something that others could ignore but once I noticed it, its all I could hear.

I suspect that the issues that I had with both set"
456,"Accurate, really good (but not the best) bass",5,"Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile, just a casual.

Really good speakers, I use it in a home gym 24ft √ó 12ft. They've got enough volume to fill the gym while maintaining quality.

The vocals and Instruments like that of string feel really accurate. The bass is real punchy, although not quite as much as I'd want it (I listen to a lot of bassy Grime & dubstep). It definitely feels the best around for the price and type (being bookshelves). For now they're enough to pump me up during workout. If I n"
457,Monitor speakers through Focusrite,5,"These work extremely well. Great sound and reasonable price and relatively compact.

You don't need isolation matts. You often just pushed to buy these as well, but they come with felt transfers if you want to sit them on a hard floor and not transfer vibration."
458,Good quality for the price,4,"For the money are the best I found. Sound quality good.
I'm using it to record rap voices and is fine even for the mixing."
459,Brilliant,5,They're just brilliant for near field listening. I now have some in my studio and another pair on my TV.
460,"good speaker, poor build quality",3,"These sound great...while they work. After three months, the slave speaker became much quieter than the active. Then it started crackling. Then distorting. Then both speakers distorted. Many others have reported this identical problem online, here and elsewhere. Clearly poor electronics.

I have owned my KRK and Yamaha monitors for almost twenty years, and they still work great. These lasted five months. Granted, for a small, near field monitor, they sounded great while they worked."
461,be warned the amazon bundle is incomplete,1,I ordered the amazon bundle of these speakers with the stand pads and cables for a christmas gift. when it arrived there is only one cable for two speakers! I was misled by the picture which gives the impression of two. Could have been a big disappointment on the big day so be warned. badly done amazon
462,Sound great!,5,"A great flat sound for something of this size and price. I used to use sn10's years ago in a studio. I'm more than happy with these speakers for my rekindled bedroom studio space. Plenty of low end, high end and mid range is fine. Maybe lacks a touch in the mid range, but nothing that will do any real harm to a mix especially once you get used to them (which is the same with anything, including speakers). Definitely recommend."
463,Extremely happy,5,"Great value for money, good quality!"
464,Fantastic quality speakers for the money,5,These speakers have exceeded my expectations in terms of build and sound quality. I would absolutely recommend these speakers for the cost.
465,Great value for money,5,Great product
466,"Excellent Sound, Great Value for Money.",5,"I originally bought some M-Audio V32‚Äôs for my small home set up, they were awful, way too bass heavy, muddy sound and no adjustments. The PreSonus sound so much better. They feel very solidly built and have a crisp sound with plenty of power for a small set up, they get quite loud without much of a drop in sound quality when turned up. They also have basic equaliser knobs on the back but I‚Äôve never needed to change them from the central position. I‚Äôve started using them for general audio consump"
467,Very good quality at a reasonable price.,5,"These monitors perform very well for my requirements: response, volume and foot print. I feed in my mixer different instruments (keyboards, bass, guitar, drum machine) and sources (iPod, CD player, a radio, the audio of my Mac) and the monitors work very well.

There is no background noise of any type.

A plus is the small foot print so that they take very little space of my work top."
468,Excellent all-rounders...,5,"The Eris E4.5's really are excellent all-rounders. In my case, they're hooked up to a computer with an ESS 9038-based DAC and mostly used for gaming and general media consumption.

Lossless audio formats like .flac and even high-quality .mp3's sound absolutely spot on! Even with the volume cranked up, highs are crisp and clear, and the mid-range is natural-sounding with lovely definition. The low-ends and bass are more punchy than deep, which is no surprise for bookshelf-sized monitors, but that"
469,Excellent. Run them on a separate electrical socket for zero mains hum issues.,5,"I bought these to replace 3‚Äù m-audio speakers that lasted 10 years. These 4.5 speakers sound much better - perfect for putting together a rough mix, and general every day listening. I have a double electric socket near my desk. My pc, monitors , usb stuff etc run on a single extension cord into one socket. These speakers run into the other socket. There is absolutely no mains hum coming from the speakers. I‚Äôm running audio from the pc headphone out into the speakers via the 3.5mm aux in at the f"
470,Beautiful,5,"Pretty little things...! Amazing sound for the price (¬£109). Crispy tweeters. Deep bass for such a light weight! The bluetooth works seamlessly. The buzz sound reported in other reviews is almost imperceptible to me. I tested the 3.5BT side-by-side with the JBL 1 series 104 and voil√†, the 3.5 is superior in sound quality by far.
The flipside: the speakers are quite lightweight and seemed fragile to scratches. But again, is sound is the main thing... don‚Äôt look anymore. I‚Äôll always wonder how muc"
471,cheap,3,I sent the speakers directly to my son in France and so did not hear them.
472,Christmas surprise ruined,3,"I'm sure the speakers are great. Unfortunately, they didn't come in a cardboard box, just the product box with a postage label on. So thanks for ruining my wife's Christmas surprise."
473,Good quality,5,Very good for a small studio
474,"Nicely made speakers, brilliant value. Sound lush.",5,"The sound is punchy and crystal clear, but not lacking character. Excellent value monitors - highly recommended."
475,Great value sound,5,"Most of the time I know what to expect when buying AV equipment and sometimes I‚Äôm disappointed, but rarely a product makes me want to right a review to shout how much of a bargain these are. I‚Äôve had a few monitors and these are up there with my older and 5x more expensive ones.
Sound great for small home studio work hooked up to mixer."
476,Good quality for price,5,Excellent value
477,Amazing monitors. I think by far best for this price range.,5,"If you are like me and like crispy crystal clear sound with tight bass then this is the monitor for you. Honestly amazing sound quality for this price bracket. I am so amazed I want to buy a second pair as a gift to my brother. For the bassheads these may seem a bit not so full, but u can adjust highs to lowest and bass to highest and still get decent sound without blurry picture.
I love these speakers.

EDIT: Actually with Treble right at the middle and Bass at 3/4 you get amazing results."
478,Good sound at a reasonable price,5,Connected to my synthesiser and sound great
479,great product,5,sound quality and volume very good
480,Wish i'd bought more Mackie CR3's instead.,2,"I really can't understand all the good reviews. As studio ''flat response'' monitors, these suck. As cheap hi-fi speakers, these suck.
.
Listening to techno through these and the bass distorts wildly. Listening to metal and the bass and high end all gets squished into the mid somehow. And listening to punk through these and the music almost vanishes completely and leaves just the vocals, like they are some kind of reverse karaoke machine!
.
Then using the headphone socket at low volumes and all "
481,Sounds awesome,5,Really really good sound. Im very happy and surprised with the sound and at this price point. Only small units but really punchy and I haven't come across any distortion. 100% recommend
482,Great speakers very good sound,5,Great sound at an affordable price....
483,Great quality when they work.,1,"Real punchy and flat response when they work.

They drop out frequently, I think they have an unadjustable setting built into them that they go to sleep so you have to blast a volume signal through to wake them up.

This happens every single time I'm using them."
484,Home studio monitor speakers,5,For the price these speakers are excellent. I bought them mainly because I am restricted for space and these were the smallest I could find that had decent reviews. I use them in a home studio set up and they do me fine.
485,My son was very pleased,5,Got them for my son to use in his recording room he was very pleased
486,Good for price.,4,"Can't knock these for the price. I use them to game and listen to music I general and watch movies.
Not bad as a second pair of reference monitors for music production either. I typically use krk rokit 6s."
487,Underpowered for my purpose,3,"OK, but I found them to be underpowered which was a surprise as they are rated at 25 watts per channel.
The interconnection wire is too short and the on/off switch is horrible.
I returned them for a refund alongside the other gear I bought to use them with."
488,Good value for money,5,"I don't have experience with studio monitors so I'd done a lot of research and listened to many comparisons before deciding on this pair of speakers. After a couple of months of using them I can say I'm happy with the purchase. The sound is clear and the response quite flat across the spectrum (judging how different commercial recordings sound - again, I've no comparison to other monitors).

The speakers have a low level hiss, even when the volume knob is turned all the way down (in fact it does"
489,Studio monitors,5,"I did a lot of reading reviews before deciding on the PreSonus Eric‚Äôs E3.5. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. These speakers are powerful, clear and user-friendly. The sound quality is excellent and, in my view, they give a true reproduction of your recording. So far, I‚Äôm very impressed with these monitors."
490,Brilliant speakers,5,These speakers are fantastic! Easily as good if not better than my M-Audio reference speakers. I love them.
491,Good studio speakers,5,Sound quality is really good
492,Good speakers,5,Good sound quality great product
493,Love them,5,Great sound for such a small speaker definitely recommend buying great price as well
494,Used them for 5min and the fuse blew up.,1,Probs not gonna buy the same brand again. Everything was amazing for half a song played and then the fuse just died.
495,They're just giving you these for a loss at this point,5,"If you need a really good pair of speakers, but you don't want to pay the large price tag good quality speakers come from, then these are for you! Although a tiny bit bass heavy sound is very crisp and sounds very good overall, they're also able to go very loud if needed, I dare not put them to the max. Perfect pair of speakers"
496,Seemingly dead on arrival - BT doesn't work but works when wired,1,"Installed as per the instructions but the led indicator above the volume controller didn't turn on when I switched it on. It seems like it's not powered on, however when connecting the cables to my laptop, there's sound coming out of it (which is really good sound). However, pairing a bluetooth device won't work. Such a shame as if it worked it would have been a good purchase."
497,Don't be fooled by their size. Great sound a pack a punch.,5,"These are great. Downsizing everything and just got rid of my KRKs which were too bulky. These are great. Small, lightweight and only use one plug socket. BT works really well so run my TV, computer and iPad through them. The sound quality for mixing and DJing through is great. Punchy and accurate. Don't have as much sun bass as the old KRKs but it's nice and tight and punchy. Really well made.and look good too."
498,Great Qaulity,5,Great sounds using them with my IPad and guitar
499,Nice and compact,5,Great just what I wanted for my digital piano!
500,Really good value for money speakers for the home studio.,4,"After comparing a number of reviews on speakers for my small home studio I was really satisfied having decided to buy these. They matched the reviews with the only reason for 4 and not 5 stars being the volume, although in fairness within the size room I have and for gauging the the sound quality needed is quite adequate.
Would definitely recommend."
501,These are not great. Save up for better ones.,2,"I returned these literally the same day I got them. Not good. I can‚Äôt see a use for them, really. They suffer from an appalling, harsh, honky midrange/upper midrange that makes your ears bleed and a lack of bass which accentuates the former. I put some Fred Wesley and the JBs on (lots of horns) and they just couldn‚Äôt handle it. They were only bearable at the lowest volume. They‚Äôre too big to use as PC speakers (for most people) but don‚Äôt sound any better than most of the so-called ‚Äòpremium‚Äô PC s"
502,Awesome sound for the price,5,"I use these in my studio in the loft, for their size they pack a punch. Bass is nice and smooth and the tweeter gives out very clear high end noises. You also have the rear controls to add more bass of treble if you wish. Really can not fault these, the price, the size and the sound are spot on, you won't find a better studio monitor pair."
503,Absolutely brilliant and awesome design!,5,"I love these speakers absolutely. They are very lovely in design as well , great sounding. No problems what so ever absolutely impressed with these glad I bought them when I did . Perfect price for what I need to do . Everything comes with the speakers all the wires come within and once opening up the box they both came in . Fast delivery as well as I'm a prime member on here . Very pleased . Might purchase another pair for my living room to have connected to the TV as the current ones I have is"
504,"Great sound, value and connectivity",5,"I tried many small monitor speaker these were easily the best and the cheapest. I believe these are the smallest monitor speakers available just right for a desktop home studio.
I liked the option of balanced TRS connectors (perfect for connecting to audio interface M-AUDIO Air 192|14. Also a bonus to have self- contained power supply so just plug in the figure-of-eight mains cable, no adapter.
The sound is full and clear and there are two adjustments for high and low EQ.
Volume control, power s"
505,Just what I wanted,5,"Having grown up with BBC monitor speakers (Spendor BC1 and Rogers LS3/5a) before forced downsizing, I wanted a pair of small self-powered monitor speakers for TV, Blu-ray and CD. Good speech quality was essential. My audio router includes level control, so the volume on the master speaker can be set and left. Top and bass +/- 6dB is a bonus on the rear, with a tactile notch at 0. No noticeable noise from the amp.
One surprise was a mains lead with European plug, but supplier had added a UK 13A m"
506,Dead on arrival,1,"Just received these speakers this morning, but you can imagine my frustration when they turn out to be dead on arrival and do not even turn on!

Attempting to contact the seller at the minute but it appears there is a problem sending them email via Amazon, so concerned now that I've spent over ¬£100 on defective goods that I won't get a replacement or a refund for."
507,Great sounding products,5,"Nice little speakers to be honest although so after buying these I did see some other speakers I preferred for a better price but that's no one else's fault but my decision but these work really well and if you're looking for a budget speaker than these are great but for some reason the price goes up and down on them so wait until you get them at a a lower price than ¬£100 as soon as I bought them the price put the price up as
I was going to get a second set but I won't be now
I have given a good"
508,True sound,5,"Did my research on these, as all I needed were computer speakers used both for watching films/shows and listening to music. So wanted something true, without enhanced bass and all that other nonsense which you can apply via an equaliser; also wanted small and lightish. They're perfect, plenty loud with a nice crisp clear sound from their 1"" tweeters, and there's that boom when things go bang on screen + I can hear dialogue clear. Tested on Abbey Road & Miss Anthropocene, 2 very crisp produced al"
509,Good value for money.,5,"Compact easy to operate good sound quality, tone controls not too dynamic but adequate at this price point. Came with a two pin plug. But they were bought at a very very good price from German seller, few quid for a replacement power cord incidental."
510,Impressive speakers for the price,5,"Purchased as desktop speakers for use with computer (to replace MAudio AV40, which had failed after a number of years use). Sound quality is subjective - various online / YouTube reviews are generally very favourable - in my opinion sound quality (especially base) is very pleasing considering the size of the speakers and an improvement on the AV40 (read the reviews for much more detailed comments on sound quality and comparisons). Extra controls provide the opportunity to fine tune the sound. Po"
511,Broke within the first month,1,"Had them a month before they stopped working, sound quality wasnt amazing (had them hooked up to a record player). Contacted their support and was told to get a new power cable.....

Waste of money"
512,Quite simply the BEST monitors under ¬£100,5,"I have been into audio and had various home studio equipment for years and years. I have had all sorts of monitors, 5 inch and 8 inch M Audios and KRKs. However this time I was looking for something compact that can fit in my IKEA Kallax desk set up.

These things look fantastic, are very compact and oh boy do they punch above their weight.

Quite simply amazing, the best monitors under ¬£100 by a long shot."
513,Good quality moitors for the size and price,5,Great value
514,"Great, crisp speakers for their size",5,"Perfect bookshelf speakers, pack punch for their size. Don't think you'll find many better in this class."
515,Good speakers,5,"Very good sound quality, great on bass and perfect for music production purposes. Would recommend to anyone looking for well priced speakers."
516,Better to do not buy this if you know something about music and quality!.,2,This speakers must be max ¬£50 look good but quality is bad...
517,Crisp and clear sound,5,Just what I needed. I wanted studio monitors to be part of a small home studio set up but they will also be the main speakers for listening to music in a small room. Seem perfect for both. It has a bass boost eq when looking for just music listening. Well designed solid small speakers that sit nicely near your PC if that's where the sound is coming from then they are real value for money.
518,Good value for budget home recording,5,Really nice speakers. Good value for money
519,Now I understand what audio resolution is.,5,"This is by far one of the best speaker sets I've purchased in a long, long time. I didn't understand what audio resolution was until I started using these. The textures and layers you hear are absolutely incredible. You hear levels to music and sound that you just can't hear with cheaper speaker sets.

I highly recommend spending that little bit extra for something that's going to give you proper quality for a long time to come. I've probably spent the same amount of the past ten years on smalle"
520,Excellent value for money with great sound,5,"So much better than my previous speakers. Able to use for music and video production, easy to set up, plenty of adjustment for sound and look fantastic. Build quality excellent too."
521,presonus monitors,5,excellent monitors and good quality and sound
522,Supreme sound for the money,5,"Can't beat these for the money. Great desktop speakers. Clear, crisp and rich sound in a small format."
523,Clarity and volume in a perfect bedroom studio setup,5,"Got these through earlier than expected and setting them up was easy enough. The quality is great and I am using them as studio monitors to great effect. The only drawback is the plug is for US plugs, so you'll need an adaptor, but the controls work, and it does what it says on the tin. Really excited to continued use with them!"
524,Don't lose out on these,4,Watching television is like going to the cinema now. My neighbor's now know all my favourite music too. All good things come in little packages. Should have bought them years ago.
525,Excellent,5,Excellent for my small studio set up
526,Fantastic,5,Cannot tell you how brilliant these monitors are. Am creating my own studio and these fit the bill despite me not knowing anything about them. Top quality for the money!!!
527,Sound great,5,"Small, easy to install, but sound great. Great price for a good sound"
528,Love them... Little bargain,5,Versus the cost these are a no brainer monitor solution. I'm using them in my lounge as output from a guitar effects board... And they sound great to me. I'm sure if you want to to and splash thousands you could find a little better... But I highly recommend these... Bargain!!!
529,Tiny with power,5,"Well I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything good for those little ones. And i was wrong. They play well and clear look lovely, headphone jack at the front with volume button as well. Good design, can‚Äôt complain for money paid and they match my new computer setup, nzxt h210 with xiaomi 34‚Äù ultrawide. Just stunning"
530,Excellent value for money.,5,Exactly value for money.
531,Died after 4 months,1,Just went down to my office this morning and noticed that the speaker has stopped working. Just won't turn on. I've plugged it into different outlets and still won't work. Also please be aware that they send it out with a 2 pin euro plug instead of a 3 pin UK one. So had to use an adapter. Very disappointed with this purchase.
532,Exactly what I was looking for!,5,"Sounds good and looks good. Fast delivery and basically exactly what i was looking for. Hopefully once I‚Äôm earning a little more dosh, i can upgrade!"
533,VERY LOUD AND GR8 QUALITY!,5,Great Speakers would recommend
534,Presonus Eris 4.5,5,My first studio monitors.Sound quality great.Happy with purchase
535,Speakers connect with magic apparently.,1,"This will be the First and Last time we ever buy any of this companies products. For the sheer fact that we got a product with no power cables or speaker cables or anything of any kind. Just 2 speakers in a box. Might be nice if you include that in the product description so that people can order the needed cables and speaker wires. Unless of course your buying a big flashy paperweight.

And sound quality and value for money is so low. Because we cant use the speakers due to the previously menti"
536,Excellent budget speakers!,5,"Doing my home mixing constantly on headphones was becoming a chore, so I decided to get some monitor speakers.

These fit the bill perfectly, decent bass, great treble, good mid, really powerful considering the size.

They look good given the price too.

I‚Äôll be considering Presonus for any other audio gear I need, clearly a very good brand."
537,Couldn't recommend enough!,5,Superb crisp punchy sound!! Fantastic quality!!
538,"Not powerfull but beautiful, clear sound",4,"I've been using these monitors to listen to music and I'm quite impressed by the sound quality of them. Low frequencies and bass lines sound so clear, not coloured in my opinion. High frequencies are nice and crispy too through these. I don't normally fiddle with the controls at the front & back but instead set everything to 0, volume at 50% and use volume and equalizer controls from my laptop.

I'm planning to use them for music production too, so they'll be part of my tiny home studio. There n"
539,Not bad,4,"Not bad, sound nice!"
540,Great sound at a good price,5,Great bang for your audio buck
541,Cheap and faulty,1,Right speaker didn‚Äôt work right out of the box. Rubbish
542,Beautiful,5,"Beautiful speakers, both in terms of sound and looks. High quality build, love them."
543,"I mean, they work?",3,"So I purchased these as a starter for my studio set up. The sound quality on them is really good for the price and the size. That said I get a crackle at a certain level. Unfortunately, it's not a level where you would expect distortion. This is the speaker cone. It's quite annoying and unfortunately means I will not be buying PreSonus again.
Easy to set up, and the sound quality is good (until you try and turn it up).
I mean for the price you pay, there are better products on the market."
544,Amazing Sound. Best I have ever heard,5,PreSonus Eris E3.5 + AudioEngine S8 Subwoofer is a nice combo but SVS SB 1000 sub is better choise. If you going for PreSonus Eris E3.5 u need to know there is no bass and u need a subwoofer to make this a 3 way system. As the description says theses are 2 way speakers - highs and mids.
545,Best speakers for hundred quid! Don't miss out!,5,"These monitors are an absolute steal at this price, the original 3.5 are still selling out everywhere! Nothing else at this price or below even comes close to the quality of sound and versatility of these amazing industrial looking boxes!

1 inch silk-dome tweeters are just something else on these beauties - the resolution, the extra wide sweetspot, the soundstage is all taken care of here. Of course it's even covered with a small metal grate so fingers can't ruin them! Bottom line, these tweete"
546,Waste of time,1,Stopped working after 10 minutes
547,Great entry level speakers,5,Excellent value speakers. I use them with my PC and I am very pleased.
548,Worth it.,5,"They are small and very loud, excellent sound quality, I use them as audio monitors for music production. And as someone who has heard a lot of monitors I can honestly say they are pretty well balanced sound wise the lowest end is about 20hz I think, normal bass is fine."
549,WOW!,5,"I wasn't expecting much from these due to the tiny driver size. I use them in my studio which is a single room about 3meters by 8 meters fully soundproofed and deadnd,, and they sound amazing and they are surprisingly powerful! They look good and sound good.. any bigger would have been a waste in my space. Great speakers!"
550,Ticks every box (if only they just looked a bit better) otherwise brilliant.,5,"I don‚Äôt do many reviews tbh.M, but these are something else.
I purchased these and the famous Pioneer DM-40 dj speakers to compare side by side.
The Pioneers apparently are more suited to edm music and the Eris3.5 best as monitor speakers for clarity.
Looks - pioneers win
Weight - pioneers win (does heavy mean better ? )
Branding - pioneers win
Size - pioneers bigger
Value - Presonus easily
Clarity - Presonus easily
Functions - Presonus - filters on rear for if the highs seem to high.
Bass - mat"
551,Great for Guitar,5,"I purchased these to go with my electric guitar setup.
I am an amateur player and was overwhelmed by all the choice for amps and pedals etc.
Anyway with the combination of my MAC, a USB interface, software called tonebridge, a subscription to Ultimate Guitar and of course these babies.
I have an entire rig setup (not including the MAC or guitar) for about ¬£130. I can create pretty much any sound.

It sounds brilliant through these, so clean.

I previously had some M-Audio AV-40 which broke, they"
552,Amazing for the size,4,"I use these for music creation and DJing at home, I really can‚Äôt fault them so far. Powerful for their size, feel well built and the sound quality is great across all frequencies (enough for my needs anyway)."
553,Presonus eris 3.5,5,"They say you get what you pay for. Well ive certainly got my moneys worth. Could of paid cheaper for these i know. However i just dont like sellers with bad feedback.

Anyway for late night listening to YouTube Netflix and Spotify i needed some speakers with less bass. For the Neighbours. So i got hold of a pair of Creative T10s. They were ok but not an enjoyable listen. Next was the ¬£129.99 Edifier R1700bt. Solidly built and well made. Aweful sound though Bass way to boomy for starters Turn it "
554,Very happy with these.,5,I like these a lot. They are not in my main music studio - they're indoors for the office ( kids computer ). Nice and small - loads of connectivity - and they sound great.
555,Perfect for home studio.,5,"Surprisingly brilliant for home studio, I wasn't expecting them to be this versatile. Well impressed."
556,Brilliant Speakers!,5,These speakers are AMAZING for the price of money! I saw a lot of reviews saying there was a lot of mains hum however if your using TRS input there is NO hum unless you put your ear up to the speaker and even when doing that the noise is minimal. I have not tried RCA so there could be more hum using that input. If you order in the UK it DOES come with a UK plug so no need to worry about buying an adapter:) These speakers for the price of money are AMAZING! they are great for mixing and perfect f
557,Presonus Eris 3.5 speakers,4,"Perfect Speakers for Home Studios
Great Sound Quality
Cheap
Also a nicely designed speaker
The delivery time was very quick even with covid-19 so it would be even faster without.
Great Purchase"
558,PreSonus Eris are better than any small bookshelf speakers I've tried!,5,"Picked these up last week for ¬£69 from another place and honestly can't believe the quality of these. All reviews are accurate, these are as minimalistic as they are light. They have a very clear presentation with sparkly treble and tightly controlled bass, but if you're sensitive to that not to worry because they also have High Freq and Low Freq controls which means you can adjust it by up to 6db plus or minus on the rear of the main (L) speaker.

For me personally it's different because I live"
559,Very good value for money.,5,Very good speakers. Very loud for size. Clarity is very good as well. Definitely recommend for anyone who want good quality speakers
560,Amazing it's not enough,5,"I wouldn‚Äôt believe if someone tells me I could have an amazing sound for this price. These speakers are simply amazing. Well built, great sound without parasites noises at the back. Highly recommended."
561,Amazing Sound. Best I have ever heard,5,
562,"Perfect - Please PreSonus, never change these",5,"In the Eris E3.5, I've found the perfect speakers for my PC...
but I would also say for a small room, these are the only speakers you'd need for any purpose.

Over the years I've tried various Cambridge Soundworks, Logitechs, Creatives etc. I used the Gigaworks T40 Series II's for almost 10 years quite happily, they were good enough. Until I got a Fiio K3 amp/dac and didn't think they did it justice, so I started my search for upgraded monitors...

Enter the Tibo Plus 1.1 (which cost more than t"
563,Brilliant,5,"Absolutely brilliant !!
Needed some new speakers for my home DJ‚Äôing as had my previous ones for a number of years and felt the sound wasn‚Äôt as clear as it could be. Read the reviews and couldn‚Äôt find a bad one, and for the price thought I‚Äôd order a pair. They are small and as I have wall brackets, I did have to cut down the extendable arm on my brackets to enable them the clamp the speaker but these were existing brackets and I was gonna make them fit either way. They are probably better to sit "
564,Small studio monitors that pack a great punch,5,"In terms of Studio Monitors, I only have experience with these 3.5"" Presonus Monitors and the much larger, much more expensive Yamaha HS8 Monitors. The Presonus Monitors sound almost as impressive as the Yamaha's. Their rich treble and thick bass makes mixing and monitoring audio a pleasure. The whole frequency spectrum is cleanly audible and the range of options for input are a great bonus."
565,Top sound,5,"Surprisingly good sound. Had previously bought a pair of Mackie CR3's, and was so unimpressed that I retuned them the same day.
After trawling the net I came across these bad boys, and never found a bad review.
For the price of these you cannot go wrong"
566,Great for PC,5,"Took a few minutes to set up. Cables included to output from my computer sound card.
A joy to listen too. I turned the treble down a touch as found it a little harsh. Left the bass in neutral.
I wouldn't use them as my hifi speaker. Bargain!"
567,Top class,5,"Safely packaged, well made, all the connecting wires to link to computer are included. Great value and a good sound for mixing down music tracks. Great purchase. Really pleased."
568,Excellent Speakers,5,"I bought these as I am starting to do a little home recording and got fed up wearing headphone all of the time.
Plugged them in and they sound excellent. Well please. Would recommend although I can not compare with other studio monitors."
569,Monitor quality on a budget.,5,"I got these Eris 4.5 powered speakers for my desktop mini-DAW setup and general AV use.
I have Genelecs for serious stuff but needed something better than my PC speakers for learning bass parts. Paid GB¬£139.00 and Amazon delivered next day.
(I notice these are the newest version (Mk 2?) with the jacks above each other and no range switches).
First impressions are highly favourable. Bass is extended with real weight and slam, kick drum sounds true.
Mids are clean and the whole audio range is basi"
570,good quality speakers,4,"For the price these are good, compact size and exactly what I needed for home studio"
571,"Fantastic sound, Great Look!",5,"I am impressed by these little speakers. The depth and loudness is amazing for the size and honestly I can't put the volume on highest anyway! I use this for my video editing and monitoring sound and this is definitely great for a home edit suite. I can trust what I hear and can hear all aspects of the mix. I had a bit of noise when I was using the rca cables but now with balanced cable and a usb interface, this is absolutely a rock star! Totally satisfied with PreSonus Eris E3.5."
572,Great value for money,4,"Very affordable pair of monitors, fairly small and light, high quality sound and easy to install.
Great value for money!"
573,Great monitors for this price point!,4,"Really happy with these speakers, very clear sound for mixing and mastering tracks. Glad i opted for the BT version so I can also use for listening to music from phone. Only did not give 5 stars because the headphone jack came in faulty (not returning because i can just plug it straight to audio interface). Definitely reccomend for the price."
574,Sound great,5,"Love em. Admittedly only had a day, but immediately used them for some mixing references and for the price, you cant go wrong."
575,Sound Quality Is Fudging AMAZING!,5,These speakers are 100% accurate and is worth the price. The bass is unbelievably amazing and its good for music production and more! deffo recommend this prduct.
576,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,"Quality little
Speakers really packing the punch"
577,Terrible unbox experience with faulty speaker.,1,"When turned on the speaker start a loud noise even when all de volume is turned to minimum.
It seems like a malfunction on the Aux-in. Very frustrating and bad experience from the first interaction with the product."
578,Very Good,5,Very good monitors for the price. Better than some of the more expensive ones out there.
579,Outstanding Studio Monitos,5,"Outstanding equipment, I chose these for my small home studio after spending a long time hunting around for the rite kit, these are two tiny monitors that pack a lot of wallop. Key words to describe them are Clean, Crisp and Clear, plus the build quality is excellent.

I have read some negative reviews and can say either people expect too much from something so compact and in this price range (seriously good at this price) or were very unlucky with getting a faulty pair."
580,DISAPPOINTED,1,"For what I need these are ideal. Great sound, crisp mids and highs. Tempted to buy the 8inch version next and use these as PC speakers. **13th May 2020 these have now developed 'THE HUM'...pretty annoyed by this as they're great sounding speakers too."
581,Quality speakers,5,"Amazing, quality speakers for home studio. Absolutely satisfied with the product üòä"
582,Small and powerful,5,"I needed some multi-media speakers for my new PC build downstairs. I already have some Focal Alpha's in my home studio upstairs, so I didn't really want something sub-standard for my PC setup, even though it's not my main computer for doing music. These small monitors had good reviews, so I though I would give them a go. Well, all I can say is, I'm very impressed. Plenty of volume for a small desktop setup, but more importantly, the quality of sound is much better than I imagined. So much so, I "
583,Great low cost speakers,5,Great value.
584,Groovy baby!!,4,"Very very good for the price! I only use them for a home studio set up, for mixing, and they sound good!"
585,Sounds good,4,Surprisingly good sound from such a small speaker
586,No British Plug Provided,5,Exellent speakers.brilliant sound.just the no british plug annoyed me a little bit.Other than that BRILLIANT speakers
587,"Wonderful pair of speakers, practical for your desktop",5,"I am not an audiophile. I was looking for a simple and good enough pair of speakers for my desktop to play music while I use the computer. After looking a lot online I ended up buying these but wasn't really sure about them. I'm glad to say they are wonderful!

The sound is fantastic, full and crisp. I can hear everything really well, with lots of details that I had not noticed before. They don't take up much space, and are really simple to set up (they don't require any external amp or anything"
588,Good sound for the price,5,Good little monitors for a small home studio. Great sound for home recording.
589,Really good,5,"These are really good speakers. It took me a few minutes to work out how everything worked, but once I did, they were fantastic.

They come with all the supplies you need and a UK plug!"
590,It‚Äôs crazy,5,The bass is good
591,Superb for the price,5,"I took a lot of other reviews on board when buying budget studio monitors - this is my first home studio set up and i am on a budget like most people, so until i have more expendable cash, im aiming to buy the best i can for my budget. These monitors are FAB for the price. such a good sound when tested and when using with my DAW. the ability to tune to the room dynamics with an EQ was brilliant for me in my makeshift home studio. I am yet to acoustically treat my room but will be done using thes"
592,Fantastic sound at a fantastic price,5,"This is one of the best purchases I've made, sound is unbelievable and speakers are small enough for a desktop. I use them to record though and they let you hear every little sound which is great for mastering tracks, highly recommend"
593,Good but!,3,Great sound for the money. Would have been 5 start... However it went bang after just over a month. Annoyingly Amazon only have 30 day return so had to return to presonus. Took a lot of wasted time with Amazon to get to that point but presonus responded rapidly and have replaced quickly under warranty. Hopefully these won't go bang as the sound quality was better than I was expecting for the money.
594,Amazing speakers + decent price = awesome speakers,5,For the price there is nothing bad i can say about these speakers.
595,Phenomenal sound,5,"Just what I have been looking forward, amazing sound and quality"
596,Great for the price,5,"These are great speakers, they have a pretty flat sound and are great for the price, I use them for general media use and mixing/djing and they are great for this. They are extremely punchy for the price as well, couldn't believe how much bass and power they have for the size.

You obviously couldn't power a big party with them as they are studio monitors at heart, but could work for smaller house parties!"
597,speakers pretty good,5,use instead of amps for guitar plus bluetooth will be used elsewhere
598,Special audio horns,5,Amazing speakers for the money üëäüèªüôåüèªüî•
599,Good quality,3,
600,Really good,5,Producing 5 years....soubd so flat..yamaha hs8 are the closest sound comparison
601,Everything,5,Good product
602,Value for money,5,"Great value for money, perfect for people on a budget who don't need audiophile quality."
603,Perfect,5,Awesome speakers they are that good might buy another pair for my next PC build :)
604,Great for anyone starting out,5,"Great for a small set up.
Good quality of sound but I already wish I had stretched for the 4.5‚Äôs.
if you‚Äôre torn between the 2, go bigger straight away because I‚Äôll be upgrading mine as soon as I can."
605,Amazing Sound For The Price.,5,"After researching many monitors in this price range via YouTube, these seemed to get great reviews every time. Extremely happy with this product."
606,Lovely little speakers,5,"Lovely quick first time speakers can go wrong the only stressfull issue is both wires for aux are faulty, so now i need new wires and its so long to send something back you have to wait up to 14 days after collecting the item before they even issue a refund which still takes another 3 to 5 working days to clear so looks like I'm buying new wires and the same for my microphone wire not with this item but another from Amazon faulty!! Its is a bit ridiculous but there you go."
607,So EPIC,5,These are wicked
608,Best in class,5,Music never sounded better
609,Cheaper speakers for audiophile Excellent frequency range,5,I have been mastering and mixing for 6 months Absolutely amazing quality and frequency adjustment High quality product and recommended
610,Good Value,4,Decent sound considering the cost.
611,Delighted with these üëåüèº,5,"Really happy with these monitors, great buy! The sound quality is excellent and a great addition to my bedroom studio"
612,Pretty accurate reference monitors,5,Best speakers I have so far
613,Superb for money,5,"Bought these as I had a budget and already owned the presonus audiobox and Studio 1. Delighted with the speakers and have to query the noise level concerns some people seem to have experienced. Mine are up full and barely a hiss! Basically, great for the money and using a separate power supply to your Mac etc. might help with the noise."
614,Great speakers,5,Very good high quality speakers
615,Very Impressed,5,"These speakers sound great. Crisp highs and punchy lows. Absolutely no hum that's been mentioned in previous reviews and a UK plug was also in the box which has also been mentioned as not present in other reviews.
Very happy with my purchase."
616,Very good speakers,5,These are brilliant in every way. I would definitely recommend.
617,"Amazing value for money however, noticed that there‚Äôs rattling specially on the kicks",5,"I‚Äôm for no reason implying that all Eris 3.5 rattle but I did notice that MY left monitor (not the passive) did rattle when music was turned louder than halfway

I only got these one 4 days ago so I ordered a replacement.

Either way these monitors sound really good (specially for it‚Äôs size)"
618,Amazing! Very bass focused though,5,"The sound quality from this is extremely good! My only issue is the higher frequencies aren't as prominent as they could be, the monitors are fairly bass focused. As someone getting into music mixing and mastering, they could be slightly flatter in frequency response. Outside of this, they're very good for listening to music and video audio. Great value for anyone on a budget!"
619,Impressive Sound but questionable quality control,3,"After a lot of research I decided on the Presonus Eris E3.5.
Sound clarity very good, good size when placed next to monitors and unobtrusive to the eye.

Why the stars?

The first set were dead in arrival one. No power, how did they pass quality control?

Secondly the Jack to RCA cable is 1.5m too short with a double more setup and base unit placement. Aftermarket 2m cable perfect."
620,Good value,5,Best at the time for the money
621,Good value,5,Great tools and professional seller. Item well packaged and arrived one day earlier. No issue at all
622,Great speakers!,5,Amazing product for the price. Needed them for film editing and they do the job nicely. Very happy with this product.
623,Quality and prescise sound and well made,5,I have seen lots of reviews for these speakers mostly good and some negatives about a power hum! Honestly just purchased these for the price you cannot do better firstly I bought the Mackie CR3 sounded nice low but turn them up the bass was horrible too much and unclear with no adjustment which was a shame! These PreSonas are superb no power hum just clear prescise sound for there size and price you will not do better! So ignore the negative comments there are none these speakers are the bizz an
624,"Great quality, great value and great sound",5,"From out of the box they were easily connected to my interface and I was ready to go. There is a great range of frequencies, and there is even dials on the back to tweak the high and low frequencies. There are multiple inputs, meaning I was able to use balanced cables to connect from my audio interface. Overall, a great set of studio monitors, coming in at a very reasonable price and with great sound and build quality."
625,"Great value, but not blown away,",4,"These entry level studio monitors offer great value and a fairly decent sound. I was a little skeptical after some reviews had mentioned a static hum due to the power supply - thankfully mine have not had this issue.

They also look great too and certainly feel like a premium product for the price paid. I had upgraded to these from some ¬£40 PC speakers and wasn't 'blown away' with the sound, but that being said, at the time of purchase, these were only around ¬£90 for the pair, which is considere"
626,Excellent value for money. Professional quality at a decent price.,5,I bought these for my sons Xmas gift. He is a recording artist and these have professional qualities for a decent price. Sound and look great. Would recommend!
627,Brilliant Budget conscious option!,5,"Fantastic Speakers, I would highly recommend. Exceeded my expectations, sound quality is great, crystal clear, loud and powerful.

Brilliant entry level into music listening or production. If you are hesitant just buy them, you truly won't regret it"
628,Amazing budget monitors!,5,Amazing budget monitors. The mains hum people speak about is absolutely minimal and not heard over normal computer sounds!
629,Superb Sound,5,These speakers were bought to replace the monitor speakers in my studio which had suddenly stopped working. They are a similar price to my previous ones but the sound quality is far superior and have controls to finely adjust the output even further. Would highly recommend.
630,Great Sound good for Ham Radio,5,"I ordered PreSonus Eris E4.5 4.5-inch, 2-way, High-Definition Active Studio Monitors (Pair) on Dec 18th and it was delivered 3 days later about 6:30PM. I was getting ready to go out so waited to Sat morning to un-box and set the speakers up, all connected in about 10 mins and tested. Wow what a great sound from such a small pair of speakers. Very pleased with my purchase. Would recommend them for someone on a tight budget. I use mine for different uses Ham radio and playing MP3 or watching video"
631,Great quality,5,As described! Perfect for what‚Äôs needed
632,"Fantastic value, but very limited bass range",3,"I sent these back as the bottom end was almost non existent. but they are VERY good value for what they are.

i opted for the iLoud Micro Monitors as they have more low end and are smaller."
633,Crazy value for money,5,My ratings are based on price and over all product. What a great pair of monitors perfect for me now as I can't use my big 6inch drivers right now. Lows are still clear and full not as deep but that's what I was looking for. Mids and highs perform well and can be boosted or attenuated if need be.
634,Does not turn on,1,"Did not turn on, makes me wonder what kind of quality control either amazon or PreSonus conducts, allowing a defective product to leave the factory. I've heard good reviews about the speakers and was looking forward to hearing them, unfortunately, they were only powered on for one second after that it never came back on, and I've tried multiple plug sockets and was unsuccessful so that leaves me to believe the speakers are broken and will never turn on. Quite frankly I'm just disappointed than a"
635,Great value for money,5,"Fast delivery, excellent sound quality perfect for my use. Great bottom end sound, clear bass and I haven't even played around with the balancing yet. Sound great out of the box. For the low price and sound quality, I would find it hard to beat them."
636,Professional audio clarity.,5,Great product. Exactly what I needed.
637,Lavely,5,lavely
638,Value for money!,5,"For what they cost the clarity is brilliant. Clear and concise sound, not alot of sub frequency but enough bass to get stuck in with producing."
639,Aarxn,5,Perfect
640,Great speakers,5,For the moment nothing I don‚Äôt like about there. Very light and portable. Sound is great but haven‚Äôt tested it on very high volumes. Using them mostly for mixing music at home and listening to vinyls.
641,Excellent Sound - No Mains Hum Whatsoever!,5,Perfect for my Home Studio - excellent sound for mixing or playing and no hum at all despite what other reviewes have commented on. Speakers are silent when on and attached to my Scarlett Solo Audio Interface. Love them so far.... very happy
642,Good Sounding Monitors,5,"Bought these to go in my second studio in the spare room. I have Tannoys for my main space but the wife and I needed somewhere to create music on a whim and the desk space is limited. These are great as reference monitors for making music but I think I would struggle to get a mixdown with them.

They sound great listening to music and YT etc. If you're just starting out in music production, need a mobile recording set up or like me just need a second pair of reliable sounding speakers, you'll be"
643,Perfect for budget home studio!,5,Great little monitors for PC use with my little home studio.
644,OMG they're Grrrrrreeeeeeaaaaaaaat,5,"Perfect for any application including professional studio work. Every bit as good as their bigger brothers. These are a steal! What are PreSonus thinking!!!

Have read all the neg' reviews I can only say either unlucky or are being economical with the truth. There is NO mains hum, there is no white noise, no crackles, no pops. The sound output is perfect across the range AND I mean PERFECT.

Headphone socket, aux input & power switch on the front is the most logical placement. Wonder why they ar"
645,Superb,5,The sound is just fantastic
646,Worth it,4,Great for the price. Compact and aesthetically pleasing.
647,Good speakers for the money,5,"Perfect for my lil room studio, versatile."
648,Great for the price point!,5,"Prior to these I had a cinema AV system for sound on my Macbook pro. My brother bought a pair of these a couple of weeks back, and when I herd them, I knew that it was time to upgrade. I am an AV Snob and for the price point they are amaing, the other benifit is I now have a lot more free desk space.

I do agree there is an extermly slight 50hz mains hum, but its not an issue for the price point (My macbook fans can be 20 times loouder than this at times)"
649,Quite Impressed.,4,"I'm using these for mixing music and I'm really quite impressed. Absolutely no electrical hum as stated in one review. Really fine detail though not a huge bass adequate for my needs, mixing a wide range of styles of music styles."
650,"Good Speaker, a bit pricey, sturdy, NOT bluetooth though",4,"Connected to my Macbook pro. By the way, for those like me who weren't clear, these speakers are NOT bluetooth speakers, you connect them with cable. Sound quality is good. Too pricey for what it is although it feels sturdy though."
651,Incredible for the price,5,"Out of the box I was dismayed to see only one of the speakers is connected to the power source - the other seemingly gets power and signal from the thin speaker wire it connects to the first speaker with. I wasn't expecting much due to that but I'm totally blown away by the sound quality. Really accurate and clearly defined positioning of sounds. Small and light for portability. For the price and sound, honestly I'm sitting here in amazement!"
652,Great quality and best monitors in comparison to competitors in the same price range.,5,"Really good set of monitors for the price, returned my m audios for these and the difference in quality is ridiculous, if you‚Äôre tor between these and other monitors around the same price I‚Äôd say just get these as they are great and do the job far better than their competitors."
653,quality,5,great near field monitor for editing or music
654,"Presonus, PLEASE bring these back!",5,It is such a shame these have been discontinued.
655,Amazing sounding for this price range,5,Wasn't expecting this sound for something in this price range. Just need a audio interface and sub now
656,Perfect for a beginner or professional music studio,5,"It is totally worth the price, in fact I think you're getting a deal by buying these. They are that good. No complaints from me. I am a music producer and they are an essential addition to my studio."
657,5 star,5,Superb sound.
658,"Excellent value, perfect speakers!",5,"Absolutely perfect for the price, couldn‚Äôt fault it at all after nearly a month of owning them. No hiss or electric problems like other has mentioned. Good for movies/music/production etc. I wouldn‚Äôt upgrade unless I decided to do a massive jump to the legendary HS5‚Äôs which are 5x the price. 5****"
659,10/10,5,"Brill speakers for a home studio, very easy to set up all wires included except the 2 jacks you will need to hook them up to your audio interface, you even get a aux cable. The delivery was ontime and packaged well all in all 5 stars"
660,Happy with product,5,Very good for the money
661,Loud and clear in a normal sized room. Bargain.,5,"Good little monitors driving my records in a good manner. They're paired with an Audio Technica turntable with built-in pre-amp. For the average room (10-15 sq metres) it's more than enough. Loud and clear, adjustable bass and treble. Bargain!!!"
662,Great sound for its price,5,Great value for money active monitor speaker. Excellent clarity despite its simple manufacturing.
663,Essential,5,"Great speakers, everything you need for a beginner home music producer"
664,Tweeter stopped working after a year or never did on active,1,"Trweeter on active wasn'tt working, or has stopped working, it's just over a year old so am annoyed seeing my passive monitors have been working for over 10 years."
665,Quality product,4,"I use it for my home studio, i have not played it loud yet but the sound quality is superb, i like the size the finish is beautiful, love it"
666,lovely clear sound,4,excellent monitors........ first class
667,Very good,4,"These are very useful little monitors for me (as a 2nd reference set) alongside my main monitors (HS7's) to get an idea of how my mixes translate to smaller speakers (and for gaming). I probably should have gone a size up though as a bit more output more for my medium sized studio room would be useful. Needless to say they are very helpful and I enjoy them a lot, they really do punch our the mids.. suprisingly punchy for a tiny set of speakers."
668,Satisfied with purchase,5,"Good sound quality, nice bass too"
669,Sound Great but could have killed me,1,I got 5 separate electric shocks whilst using gear on the presonus speakers. I managed to whittle it down to the speakers causing the issue after trying some different plug sockets and gear. So yeh not good at all really. After reading some recent reviews it looks like something is up with the internal electronics. I am going to contact support at try get a repair otherwise these will be going back for sure lol
670,Simple Excellent For Under ¬£100,5,"I needed a small pair of monitors to use in my flat, as I didnt want to get evicted buying anything too big.
I usually use a pair of Yamaha HS5s , and its been a smooth transition coming from those to the Pre-Sonus.

Pros:
1 - Sound : nice and crisp with a 2-band EQ to tailor the high and low frequencies. Not boomy or flabby, and they seem to do well.
2 - Balanced Inputs : no noise as I am running my Yamaha AG06 into these guys from a laptop. There was no noise using unbalanced cables, but this "
671,Works well for mixing,5,I can definitely hear a difference in my mixes/masters compared to a flat-frequency studio headphones. My work has improved for it.
672,Brilliant value for money. A must have for a budget recording setup,5,"I used for my recording set up. Sounds way better than I expected. I have had mine around 3 years and they are perfect. Always working well. One of my friends uses these and also loves them. I use mine with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 2nd gen, which is also fabulous. These produce a very rich sound. When it came, however, it had a European mains adaptor, rather than a U.K. This wasn‚Äôt much of a problem as I had lots of spares, but could be an issue for you."
673,power,5,A compact and small but very powerful monitors.
674,Lack XLR's,4,Shame these lack XLR connectors on the back. Otherwise a solid if unremarkable speaker that function well as 'computer speakers' on an edit suite.
675,Brilliant sound,5,"Theres a slight Hum on it frequently, but not noticeable if your playing something."
676,"Really great sound, love em",5,Great bins
677,Nice,5,"Just for use on my computer for games mp3s and so on. Nice quality sound and build, let's hope they last."
678,Presonus Eris 4.5 Great Sound and Price,5,"Great Value and no issues with Hum, Hiss or Buzzing as some people report. The sound is flat, clean and well difined. I'm using with Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol and Arturia Keyboard recording Equipment. Very impressed. If Sub Bass is important for general listening you may wish to use a Sub Woofer. I'm using a ELAC Sub 2030, complemented with Bose and Yamaha Equipment. These Prosonus Monitors are a fantastic purchase and I cannot believe the quality for price. There are better but you'll"
679,"Fantastic value, professional mixes.",5,"Before using these I was using small laptop speakers with a sub so my mixes were always lacking bass (because the sub gave me a false representation). Now my mixes sound so much better, it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt need to worry about now that I know these speakers are doing a great job. Well worth the money, definitely invest if you are thinking about it."
680,Perfect for home studio,5,"Couldn't rate these more highly for general use or for a home recording set up.

Even better if you take the time to tune the bass.

Others have commented on a noticeable hum. I followed the installation instructions and moved the mains plug to a socket, away from other equipment. Worked fine after that."
681,DOA,1,"Picked up at Amazon lockers across the road and were DOA no power within minutes. Tried with my TV power cord and tested power cable for continuity. Regret ordering a replacement for tomorrow and will refuse pickup. Now have to travel 45 minutes to send the first unit back, why not allow the store with Doddle free service and lockers to take them in?"
682,Very nice set-up for a nice price,5,"Very accurate speakers,bit low on bass end"
683,Good value for money and adjustability,5,"I think they're good value for money. I like the various adjustability features, a lot. They are very clear, and reasonably transparent. Definitely useful for home recording and monitoring, less so for ""Hi Fi"" - as they are going to reveal any slightly less perfect mastered tracks, and thus be a less than relaxing listen."
684,"They're perfect, if you don't have much space.",5,"I bought these to play the guitar through a Line 6 HX Stomp and they are perfect for it. The response is quite neutral, which is perfect for emulating an amplifier. They're fairly small, relatively cheap and sound amazing. Certainly works for basic audio editing, but I have nothing to compare them to, nor do I do this professionally, so your mileage may vary."
685,These are incredible for the price,5,"Ok, mostly great reviews and I am on board with that. For those talking about a hum - I don't have that with mine, though I am using high quality cables, so if that's something you're on the fence about, go get yourself a set of balanced or unbalanced connectors and hopefully you won't have that issue.
I was on the fence because of the price - as in I thought it was too low for anything to be decent. I was wrong.
Response wise from this, I am blown away. It is simply incredible. Thanks to the ac"
686,Unbeatable Value,5,"I was looking for a set of monitors to mix down live recordings but didn't want to spend much. After reading good reviews, I bought these. I first tried them on my TV/Media setup and the difference was immediate! A very nice, balanced sound but it was the clarity and definition which really impressed. Later, hooking them up in the studio, the bass was immediately boomy but Presonus had thought of that with controls adapting to your listening environment. My only gripe is the lack of XLR in altho"
687,Get them! The best budget speaker for true clarity in your music,5,"I've had a home studio now for a few years. Regrettably, I had to sell a lot of my equipment last year, including my old monitors which were Adam F5s. Now I am slowly building up my home studio again from the bottom up. Looking to get stuff on a budget and slowly upgrade bit by bit. After searching many reviews online about different monitors for a budget, I decided on these. What a great decision! I make house music and have had many chart entries on the digital stores, so I kinda know what I'm"
688,Great sound quality,5,"Perfect for mixing on at home. There sound quality even with mp3 not WAV files is superb. The bass is clear and the sound quality excellent. I was advised to buy by a friend who really knows his stuff. Yes they are cheap but the sound is not!
Not house party loud but that's not what they are for. If you want clear quality sound on a budget there fantastic
Very happy"
689,Nice micro active speakers ruined by noisy electronics,3,"The good bits:

1- powerful amp capable of filling average size room.
2-The speakers sound is strong, well balanced and puchy. Both top and bottom ends are fairly weak, but I am comparing these to Beyerdynamic DT990 headphones.
3- Easy setup as all connection leads for inputs and speaker connections supplied and power cable has a UK 3 pin plug.

The bad bits:
Sadly these active speakers have some major problems that makes them unusable in my opinion.

1- The sound level left and right is not equ"
690,"Forward, unbalanced sound",3,"I so wanted to love these speakers, nearly everything about their design and sonic signature ticked all the boxes, other than the really forward upper midband around the crossover point (circa 2k-3k).

Initially the forwardness makes the speakers sound bright and detailed, but in the long term this 'injected with adrenalin' presentation is artificial, fatiguing, and misguiding to mix with. You won't even realise you've subliminally compensated for their forwardness in the EQ of your mixes until "
691,Nice sound and practical for the budget home audio studio.,5,"Got this for mixing audio, seem pretty good out the box. They are highly rated on the various review sites of 'budget' studio monitors, and I liked the headphone jack option and the attenuation controls. The supplied cables are poor quality though. I had a few compatible power cables lying around otherwise would have had to buy a decent UK type. Good compact size for a micro home studio and wit decent connection options. I like them."
692,Eris E4.5. No any severe hum or hiss as other described at times.,4,"I did not purchase from Amazon as found better deal elsewhere. Early 'hours' so can't comment on many aspects yet. Design is nice, speakers feels solid. Sound is good to my ears thus far, not burned in yet although I don't really know if that will make a change. I can hear only very slight hum and hiss from about 2 feet away when in completely silent room. This is not annoying at all so I guess I must be lucky with my particular pair and others must have faulty units or units with different comp"
693,Would recommend for the price,5,Love it
694,2 pin mains plug...,2,Haven't been able to try them yet as they've arrived with a 2 pin mains plug... Not useful in the UK so I've had to buy a 3 pin adapter. When tried I'll post a full review.
695,"Good sound, appalling mains hum",1,"I bought these to replace the E3.5 which were recalled due to a power fault. At first, I was really pleased. The sound was great for the money; excellent flat for studio monitors. But then I noted the hum. It's awful. You can hear it above the computer fan. I sometimes even appears on recordings if I'm doing voice overs at the desk. As others have said, it really let's down an otherwise great product. I was going to buy another pair as a replacement in the hole mine was a one off, but having jus"
696,"Good sound overall, but transformer/amp noise is disappointing",3,"So far on the first day, seems to be overall a decent set of speakers. Well designed in general, seem well made and pretty solid overall. Tonal balance is *really* nice for the size and price point; they're nearly as sweet as my much more expensive hifi speakers and amp downstairs. Bass is pretty well controlled and tight, treble sparkly and detailed, and the mids clear and defined. The adjustments on the back make it easy to tweak for your particular circumstances - I had to trim the 'Acoustic "
697,Perfect for almost all your needs! (studio and sound),5,"Crystal clear sound, high dynamics and range. Couldn‚Äôt buy anything better with that price tag."
698,Five Stars,5,I love these speakers. They are powerful in a home studio and you hear every detail.
699,Bad Transformer Hum,2,"Having read lots of excellent online reviews I received these monitors with high expectations. I connected everything up and straight off listened to a variety of music just to check what others had been saying. Must say that they sounded really good. But then when things were quiet...the dreaded low level hum. Clearly audible over the fans of the computer. I disconnected all cables, the hum was still there. I then changed electrical sockets but the hum was still there. I hooked up my previous E"
700,Awesome speakers for the price.,5,"This set is amazing value for money. Awesome sound (for the price). I use this set for tv speakers, computer speakers. Further, I also use it as speakers for a Sonos Connect. They produce a wonderful full sound. No need for a sub when i use them for my extra tv. Some might find them a bit bulky for pc speakers, but if you have the space for them at your desk, you should concider them."
701,Excellent,5,Excellent
702,Five Stars,5,Love these speakers... I made a good choice.
703,Good value for price.,5,Does the job. Reasonably priced.

They were bought, primarily to replace a pair of trusty Behringer MS40's in my new project studio. Not had chance to set hem up properly yet, but i did a test run with a couple of tracks and they sound great. I'll admit i was a little apprehensive about purchasing the 4.5's mainly because some have mentioned a mains hum from one of thje speakers. im happy to report this pair a"
705,Five Stars,5,Fantastic speakers! So pleased.
706,"Nice speakers, but a design flaw results in excessive mains hum in left speaker",2,"Re the hum, actually I think you're underplaying it...it's really bad (especially in a quiet living room where the audible mains hum in the left speaker is intolerable). I have resolved the mains hum issue....but the solution is ugly.

So, I bought a pair of secondhand Eris e4.5 a couple of days ago off EBAY ...& instantly noticed the hum in the main active speaker was terriblle. I therefore consulted the net & read of many reports of this hum (I therefore suspected design fault, vs. being sold "
707,Gives a nice clear flat signal,5,"Gives a nice clear flat signal, exactly what you want from a set of monitors. Great to mix, produce and write on. I highly recommend them."
708,Amazing sound at this price,4,"I have had the Eris E4.5s for a year now and have thoroughly enjoyed the open, clear, balanced and engaging sound that they produce.

To be clear I‚Äôm not a sound engineer, I just enjoy mixing and making music in my spare time. I purchased them to replace a pair of Alesis Monitor One MKII as I didn‚Äôt have enough space for the larger monitors.

I use the E4.5s both for listening to music and for mixing and they are perfect for both. The soundstage is nice and wide and they sound pretty flat for a "
709,... than a review I bought these speakers and was happy when I got them out the box build qaulity ...,3,This is more of a question than a review I bought these speakers and was happy when I got them out the box build qaulity is excellent but when plugged then in I got no power what so ever I was quite confused by this and after emailing inta sound asking for an exchange I decided to have another look at them and noticed the fuse was blown I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this or weather it was just bad luck that I received a faulty pair of monitors ? Thanks in advance
710,great,5,Sound is nice and clear with these. Nice and flat sound makes it good to produce music with better clarity and also good for mixing music
711,Excellent speakers. Comes with a power lead that doesn't ...,5,Excellent speakers. Comes with a power lead that doesn't fit UK socket though. Had to purchase a power lead.
712,Crap Product,1,Had since February. Now mains socket crackles and cuts out music. Crap product and Amazon won't let me return it. Very disappointed
713,which despite the rave reviews were pretty dire for music playback,5,"Got these to replace a pair of Creative T20's, which despite the rave reviews were pretty dire for music playback. I'm not an audiophile, but the quality of sound produced by the Ceres is a revelation in comparison. The speakers will still be bedding in so the sound will only improve. Very pleased with purchase."
714,Four years later - in constant use - sounding better than ever,5,"UPDATE - so.. four years after buying them. I'm just sat here listening to some bass heavy drum and bass and thinking just how damn fine these speakers are. Superb sounding, crisp bass and clean high frequencies... still great after four years of daily heavy use.

(the original review>>) accurate, balanced, clean, chunky and rather sweet......... love them and happy to recommend. Great value and great sound"
715,ok,5,"Incredible sound, good quality!"
716,Great little speakers,5,"Great speakers... really compact, yet with a beautiful, balanced sound. Wide range of connections, including bluetooth connectivity. They also have a basic ""equalizer"" (high/low), but the sound is so good that I didn't even touch it. With my previous speakers, from a famous German low-cost brand, I couldn't achieve a decent sound no matter how I set them, though they were advertised as monitor speakers.
Highly recommended and well worth the price."
717,Really clear sound and excellent for listening to classic rock and hearing all instruments ...,4,"Really clear sound and excellent for listening to classic rock and hearing all instruments without vocals being ruined.
Poor bass, but to be expected.
Recommended speakers for sure."
718,I bought these speakers at the beginning of Jan 2016 ...,2,"I bought these speakers at the beginning of Jan 2016 and thought the sound was OK (not as special as I was expecting). There was some background 'hum' and buzzing and after a week they just wouldn't power up one morning. I checked fuses which were all OK. No idea what could possibly have gone wrong. I reported it to Amazon and was offered a full refund but I'd rather have had a working set of speakers.
On the plus side, there's loads of connections and build quality felt good."
719,Poor sound even for this money,2,Poor sound even for this money. But good for easy music listening. A sound bar will do the same though !
720,mains plugged in and speakers are making horrible repetitive pulsing noise with out being connected to anything,2,"Straight out of box, mains plugged in and speakers are making horrible repetitive pulsing noise with out being connected to anything, noise gets louder as you turn the volume up. Had to return and such a shame as I was really looking forward to trying them out :("

725,PRESONUS ERIS E4.5 - 25W ACTIVE (PAIR) 4.5...,5,"These speakers are absolutely brilliant.
Superb build quality and sound.
We have them hooked up to the TV; they really come into their own with music, but are just as good for normal TV dialogue.
I also use the 3.5mm jack input for MP3, phone, tablet, whatever; superb sound, more than enough volume.
Clear treble, no harshness, the bass end is great too; will provide a good deep bass that is never muddy.
Adjustments for sound delivery; to tune to your taste.
Pretty impressive units for size and c"
726,Five Stars,5,Speedy delivery - highly quality items
727,Bargain price! A great deal!,5,"These are a snatch at this price. Needed a set of monitors for mixing and recording on, but the space is only my bedroom and fairly small.
Build quality on these is brilliant. Sound is great and can be tweaked nicely. Front headphone output and in are nice, standard inputs at back.
Overall a great purchase, definitely worth the money. Perform just as well as many higher priced speakers. Unless you're going to spend a good few times more on monitors, these are probably the best you can get, and c"
728,Five Stars,5,Such a clean sound off these bad boys!
729,Nice one Presonus ^.^,5,"Arrived as new, these monitors are the best value for money as well as quality. I like everything about them, control, look, and sound quality. I'm having to put up with aux inputs for the time being until i get some new cables, so there is some humming floating around but with proper input cables they are so good. Everything i expect of Presonus, they are a great brand."
730,"At this price, an absolute steal!",5,"Great speakers. Nice bass, mid and treble. My first monitor speakers, and very, very pleased. Hooked up to my PC, and I can no listen to all my tunes without any distortion. Got some audio foam for the base, just to limit any rattling, none at all. Brilliant, and at the price they are now, ¬£116, an absolute steal. Even at top price, people were saying these speakers give great value for money. Just over ¬£50 for each speaker is the bargain of the year!"
731,"Awesome monitors, everything I wanted in a pair of miniature powered speakers",5,"These monitors are a revelation!

Everything I wanted in a miniature monitor is basically provided: sounds pop out of the speakers in a three-dimensional way, there is crisp and clean treble, clear and realistic mid-range, and a very reasonable amount of bass for the size. Stereo imaging is good, and I have not found them at all fatiguing to listen to.

As with most other ported designs, in an untreated room at close proximity to walls, I find it's best to roll off the bass with one of the ""Low "
732,Five Stars,5,These are amazing speakers for studio recording! :D
733,Four Stars,4,Excellent bass from such a small speaker package.
734,Great budget monitors but check voltage selector before plugging in!,5,"Excellent buy. Go great with my Presonus studio 1 and firebox. I had been mixing via headphones and hi fi speakers. The monitors make a world of difference. One caveat the manual says that voltage selector on the speakers will be set to that of the country where purchased mine wasn't and needed changing - make sure you check it to avoid a blown fuse - or worse!. Also came with the wrong power lead. Although annoying, for the price, these are still worth five stars."
735,Five Stars,5,great sound from a compact low price monitor. recommended.
736,"Fantastic, clear sound in a very compact package",4,"Fantastic, clear sound in a very compact package. That being said, I do get a tiny bit of (mains?) hum from them, and (as other reviewers have noticed) they're not 100% screened against external interference - they will occasionally pickup my mobile, possibly over the speaker cable link to the passive speaker.
But the sound is excellent, great bass for a set this size, and the build quality is rock solid."
737,Five Stars,5,Great speakers for the money with slick design.
