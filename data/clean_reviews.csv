1,i didn't realise how bad my audio setup was,"considering i used to have quite a respectable setup many years ago i've feel into a trap of using bluetooth speakers which leave a lot to be desired. for the price these provide a perfect audio experience. now i'm only filling a 3x3m room so hardly an auditorium but the quality is amazing. i do feel like i could do with a subwoofer for some genres but for the average listening experience, without the neighbours complaining, it's beautiful. almost brings a tear to my eye.","considering used quite respectable setup many years ago i've feel trap using bluetooth speakers leave lot desired. price provide perfect audio experience. i'm filling 3x3m room hardly auditorium quality amazing. feel like subwoofer genres average listening experience, without neighbours complaining, beautiful. almost brings tear eye.","i didn't realise how bad my audio setup was. considering used quite respectable setup many years ago i've feel trap using bluetooth speakers leave lot desired. price provide perfect audio experience. i'm filling 3x3m room hardly auditorium quality amazing. feel like subwoofer genres average listening experience, without neighbours complaining, beautiful. almost brings tear eye.",5,Positive,2023,5,27

4,wonderful monitors,"it's been some years since using any monitors as i use dt770 250's for all my audio work and wow, i'm so pleased i added these to my studio...first the sound...the sound is quite flat which is good as you can accurately eq your sound. the bass is ""even"", meaning that it's there but it's not exaggerated. the mids are very well balanced (they sound great) and the high end is also fairly well balanced and you can get some nice air and snap when eqing. for those that have the bayer dynamic dt770 250's, you'll find your headphones have more ""air"" and snap a bit more in the highs by default, the lower mids probably have a little more punch, but not much. going back and forth between the 770's and the monitors should be a similar(ish) experience...build quality and size..very petit in size, they don't take up much room. the build is absolutely fine for the price. no issues there...you have standard connections by means of speaker wire and phono to 3.5mm (unbalanced). i'd recommend using some trs to trs to help eliminate noise from emf...on the backs you also have access to bass and treble knobs to help tune the sound to your room...on the front you have the power switch and 3.5mm ports for headphones and phone so you can play music from your phone via the correct cable, usually 3.5mm to 3.5mm. just note that the headphone in isn't powerful enough to power 250ohm headphones...overall, these monitors are brilliant and well worth the price.","years since using monitors use dt770 250's audio work wow, i'm pleased added studio...first sound...the sound quite flat good accurately eq sound. bass ""even"", meaning not exaggerated. mids well balanced (they sound great) high end also fairly well balanced get nice air snap eqing. bayer dynamic dt770 250's, find headphones ""air"" snap bit highs default, lower mids probably little punch, not much. going back forth 770's monitors similar(ish) experience...build quality size..very petit size, take much room. build absolutely fine price. no issues there...you standard connections means speaker wire phono 3.5mm (unbalanced). i'd recommend using trs trs help eliminate noise emf...on backs also access bass treble knobs help tune sound room...on front power switch 3.5mm ports headphones phone play music phone via correct cable, usually 3.5mm 3.5mm. note headphone isn't powerful enough power 250ohm headphones...overall, monitors brilliant well worth price.","wonderful monitors. years since using monitors use dt770 250's audio work wow, i'm pleased added studio...first sound...the sound quite flat good accurately eq sound. bass ""even"", meaning not exaggerated. mids well balanced (they sound great) high end also fairly well balanced get nice air snap eqing. bayer dynamic dt770 250's, find headphones ""air"" snap bit highs default, lower mids probably little punch, not much. going back forth 770's monitors similar(ish) experience...build quality size..very petit size, take much room. build absolutely fine price. no issues there...you standard connections means speaker wire phono 3.5mm (unbalanced). i'd recommend using trs trs help eliminate noise emf...on backs also access bass treble knobs help tune sound room...on front power switch 3.5mm ports headphones phone play music phone via correct cable, usually 3.5mm 3.5mm. note headphone isn't powerful enough power 250ohm headphones...overall, monitors brilliant well worth price.",5,Positive,2023,5,21

9,crackling sound when connected to bluetooth,"i’d like to preface this review by saying i tried 2 different sets of these speakers (both the bluetooth version), brand new, and both had the exact same issue, so must be a model issue rather than a one-off problem...the first pair i bought had a constant crackling/buzzing noise coming from the passive speaker when connected to bluetooth. the noise disappeared when disconnected from bluetooth, but appeared instantly when connected. it was audible at low volumes which ruined the listening experience so i exchanged for another set...this second set had the exact same problem. i tried connecting a different bluetooth device, i tried moving the speakers to different rooms, moving electrical devices away, swapping cables around… but the noise would not disappear no matter what i tried...really disappointing and has massively turned me away from purchasing presonus products again...i started the returns process on 2nd may 2023, posted the item the same day, and still have not had a refund - today is 12th may 2023. would love an update on my refund please?","i’d like preface review saying tried 2 different sets speakers (both bluetooth version), brand new, exact issue, must model issue rather one-off problem...the first pair bought constant crackling/buzzing noise coming passive speaker connected bluetooth. noise disappeared disconnected bluetooth, appeared instantly connected. audible low volumes ruined listening experience exchanged another set...this second set exact problem. tried connecting different bluetooth device, tried moving speakers different rooms, moving electrical devices away, swapping cables around… noise not disappear no matter tried...really disappointing massively turned away purchasing presonus products again...i started returns process 2nd may 2023, posted item day, still not refund - today 12th may 2023. love update refund please?","crackling sound when connected to bluetooth. i’d like preface review saying tried 2 different sets speakers (both bluetooth version), brand new, exact issue, must model issue rather one-off problem...the first pair bought constant crackling/buzzing noise coming passive speaker connected bluetooth. noise disappeared disconnected bluetooth, appeared instantly connected. audible low volumes ruined listening experience exchanged another set...this second set exact problem. tried connecting different bluetooth device, tried moving speakers different rooms, moving electrical devices away, swapping cables around… noise not disappear no matter tried...really disappointing massively turned away purchasing presonus products again...i started returns process 2nd may 2023, posted item day, still not refund - today 12th may 2023. love update refund please?",1,Negative,2023,5,12

17,everything you've ever wanted - best sound ever.,"presonus e5bt incredible clear sound. these reference speakers are absolutely brilliant for a desktop setup with a laptop or desktop computer. ideal for small studios. the e5bt gives excellent sound, has lots of functionality, is easy to setup, a pleasure to use. everything you could want is on the front of the left speaker – power, volume, line in, phones out, & bt5 that works very well – easy connect anything. the 5 inch driver gives a full clear sound & the rear port adds a solid accurate bass response. eq as flat as a pancake. only the left speaker is actively amped, the right is passive. the amp jumps in output to 50w in the 5’s & is better quality - the 3 & 4 inch are 25w. uniquely there’s a trs sub-out which is nice, so connecting a sub is quick, easy & cheap. they are rear ported so they need some space – not bang up against a brick wall. basic acoustic modeling for the chosen speaker position is possible with controls at the rear of the speaker - see end of post for studio setup. for the lowest volumes you’ll need to cut the line volume. the freebie music software is a distraction, so don’t waste your time - get ableton..the e5bt’s quality & clarity makes music production a dream. you can hear every detail, so every track can be picked out, modified & levels accurately set. dump the cables supplied in the box & get some good quality shielded cable connectors. tisino make a trs stereo splitter cable from amazon - a good choice for a basic direct computer connection with a 3.5 jack. all line voltages should be well shielded or you risk interference, hum, crosstalk. as with all pro speakers its good practice to switch the power to the speakers - off first - on last - accidental pops & explosive cracks do damage..these are near field but it’s worth getting the 5 inch as there is no substitute for shifting lots of air – the 5’s have a full solid bass & double the amp power, so you get lots of headroom before distortion. they are good value for money. these speak","presonus e5bt incredible clear sound. reference speakers absolutely brilliant desktop setup laptop desktop computer. ideal small studios. e5bt gives excellent sound, lots functionality, easy setup, pleasure use. everything want front left speaker – power, volume, line in, phones out, & bt5 works well – easy connect anything. 5 inch driver gives full clear sound & rear port adds solid accurate bass response. eq flat pancake. left speaker actively amped, right passive. amp jumps output 50w 5’s & better quality -

18,did not like at first?,"these are near-field monitor speakers designed to have a flat frequency response. this means they need to be closer to you at near-ear height, with speaker separation dependent on distance to form that optimum triangle you complete in the recommended listening position. unlike consumer speakers with eq set at speaker level, these provide an uncoloured flat eq response. this gives a more accurate representation of the input sound source, so now you can mix your audio without adding any unwanted eq bias. straight out of the box and not tuned to my room acoustics, i didn't like they were slightly bass heavy due to the lower frequencies of sound reflecting off walls. i tweaked the bass by -1 db and the treble by +1 db, the result is now perfect for my purposes. the bluetooth connectivity is just a convenient function for me, the front on/off switch, volume control, aux in and headphones out are great design features. i recommend using the balanced trs inputs. the build quality of this product is excellent. don't forget to register for software downloads and a handy setup tutorial.","near-field monitor speakers designed flat frequency response. means need closer near-ear height, speaker separation dependent distance form optimum triangle complete recommended listening position. unlike consumer speakers eq set speaker level, provide uncoloured flat eq response. gives accurate representation input sound source, mix audio without adding unwanted eq bias. straight box not tuned room acoustics, didn't like slightly bass heavy due lower frequencies sound reflecting walls. tweaked bass -1 db treble +1 db, result perfect purposes. bluetooth connectivity convenient function me, front on/off switch, volume control, aux headphones great design features. recommend using balanced trs inputs. build quality product excellent. forget register software downloads handy setup tutorial.","did not like at first?. near-field monitor speakers designed flat frequency response. means need closer near-ear height, speaker separation dependent distance form optimum triangle complete recommended listening position. unlike consumer speakers eq set speaker level, provide uncoloured flat eq response. gives accurate representation input sound source, mix audio without adding unwanted eq bias. straight box not tuned room acoustics, didn't like slightly bass heavy due lower frequencies sound reflecting walls. tweaked bass -1 db treble +1 db, result perfect purposes. bluetooth connectivity convenient function me, front on/off switch, volume control, aux headphones great design features. recommend using balanced trs inputs. build quality product excellent. forget register software downloads handy setup tutorial.",5,Positive,2023,4,28

445,impressive - once setup properly but bluetooth could be better,"when i first got these speakers, i really didn't like them..1. the bass was boomy making the low and mid all a bit 'muddy'. checking on the presonus faqs it is recommended to keep the speakers away from the walls by 4 feet (1.5ft mentioned elsewhere) because of the rear port, so i pulled them forward and the boomy muddyness had gone, delivering a balanced sound with detail and punch. i was thinking of adding a subwoofer but i'm not going to bother - i like the sound as is (obviously these speakers won't shake the room)..2. there is a background hiss when using bluetooth, higher than when using the rca inputs. presonus helped by suggesting turning the source (e.g. your phone) to maximum volume and turning down the volume on the speakers. the hiss is now low enough not to be noticeable in normal use..3. the bluetooth mostly doesn't reconnect to previously paired devices. i have to press the pair button every time i turn the speakers on.4. the volume isn't the highest. these are advertised ' it may be small but the e3.5 is loud, as well as clear' but don't expect anything like your home hifi with 50w amp. i don't turn my home hifi up much at all (not after annoying the neighbors) but these need turning up much more. but they are near field monitors not dj speakers...on balance, i love these speakers. great detailed balanced sound. ideal for streaming 6 music at my desk while working from home without disturbing the rest of the house. bluetooth could be better but good enough for my use, no way good enough for music production (but then you wouldn't be using bluetooth anyway)...ps no problems with mains hum as some report. this is probably because i've not wired them to another piece of mains equipment which creates ground loops.","first got speakers, really didn't like them..1. bass boomy making low mid bit 'muddy'. checking presonus faqs recommended keep speakers away walls 4 feet (1.5ft mentioned elsewhere) rear port, pulled forward boomy muddyness gone, delivering balanced sound detail punch. thinking adding subwoofer i'm not going bother - like sound (obviously speakers won't shake room)..2. background hiss using bluetooth, higher using rca inputs. presonus helped suggesting turning source (e.g. phone) maximum volume turning volume speakers. hiss low enough not noticeable normal use..3. bluetooth mostly doesn't reconnect previously paired devices. press pair button every time turn speakers on.4. volume isn't highest. advertised ' may small e3.5 loud, well clear' expect anything like home hifi 50w amp. turn home hifi much (not annoying neighbors) need turning much more. near field monitors not dj speakers...on balance, love speakers. great detailed balanced sound. ideal streaming 6 music desk working home without disturbing rest house. bluetooth better good enough use, no way good enough music production (but wouldn't using bluetooth anyway)...ps no problems mains hum report. probably i've not wired another piece mains equipment creates ground loops.","impressive - once setup properly but bluetooth could be better. first got speakers, really didn't like them..1. bass boomy making low mid bit 'muddy'. checking presonus faqs recommended keep speakers away walls 4 feet (1.5ft mentioned elsewhere) rear port, pulled forward boomy muddyness gone, delivering balanced sound detail punch. thinking adding subwoofer i'm not going bother - like sound (obviously speakers won't shake room)..2. background hiss using bluetooth, higher using rca inputs. presonus helped suggesting turning source (e.g. phone) maximum volume turning volume speakers. hiss low enough not noticeable normal use..3. bluetooth mostly doesn't reconnect previously paired devices. press pair button every time turn speakers on.4. volume isn't highest. advertised ' may small e3.5 loud, well clear' expect anything like home hifi 50w amp. turn home hifi much (not annoying neighbors) need turning much more. near field monitors not dj speakers...on balance, love speakers. great detailed balanced sound. ideal streaming 6 music desk working home without disturbing rest house. bluetooth better good enough use, no way good enough music production (but wouldn't using bluetooth anyway)...ps no problems mains hum report. probably i've not wired another piece mains equipment creates ground loops.",4,Positive,2021,1,14

560,presonus eris are better than any small bookshelf speakers i've tried!,"picked these up last week for £69 from another place and honestly can't believe the quality of these. all reviews are accurate, these are as minimalistic as they are light. they have a very clear presentation with sparkly treble and tightly controlled bass, but if you're sensitive to that not to worry because they also have high freq and low freq controls which means you can adjust it by up to 6db plus or minus on the rear of the main (l) speaker...for me personally it's different because i live in a flat, i actually turned down the bass by -1 to -2db and they sound great hooked up to my somewhat antique fiio e7 dac/amp with a wolfson 8740 audiophile level chip via 3.5mm to rca loops uk audio cables. sound signature and synergy from this combo is very musical, with great definition and sense of space. i also tried it with an xtrempro x1 ess sabre 9023 dac (available here on amazon for about £34 shipped i think), and the sound synergy is pretty cold, rather forward and aggressive but still with decent soundstage. definitely more analytical, however this gets fatiguing for someone like me who listens to music for 2+ hours a day!..edit (14/05): i have upgraded the slightly thin l/r stock speaker wire that you get in the box to a much more reliable 250~ strand shielded cotton filled 99.9% ofc copper wire and i feel like there is a definite differnce but hey i only hooked it up today so it could be just placebo. i aint going back to the stock cable thats for sure!..i will also be getting a 3.5mm to 6.35mm lr interconnect cable (not balanced) so i can use the trs inputs and test to see if the audio quality improves or changes. will report back here soon! keep an eye out if you wanna know...---.conclusion:..these are hands down the best speakers i've ever had hooked up to my pc... and i have owned many in the past - trust, cambridge soundworks, 1byone, edifier e10bt, creative t20ii, creative t40ii (amazing but very much like dinosaurs, go for them if you like jurassic park","picked last week £69 another place honestly can't believe quality these. reviews accurate, minimalistic light. clear presentation sparkly treble tightly controlled bass, sensitive not worry also high freq low freq controls means adjust 6db plus minus rear main (l) speaker...for personally different live flat, actually turned bass -1 -2db sound great hooked somewhat antique fiio e7 dac/amp wolfson 8740 audiophile level chip via 3.5mm rca loops uk audio cables. sound signature synergy combo musical, great definition sense space. also tried xtrempro x1 ess sabre 9023 dac (available amazon £34 shipped think), sound synergy pretty cold, rather forward aggressive still decent soundstage. definitely analytical, however gets fatiguing someone like listens music 2+ hours day!..edit (14/05): upgraded slightly thin l/r stock speaker wire get box much reliable 250~ strand shielded cotton filled 99.9% ofc copper wire feel like definite differnce hey hooked today placebo. aint going back stock cable thats sure!..i also getting 3.5mm 6.35mm lr interconnect cable (not balanced) use trs inputs test see audio quality improves changes. report back soon! keep eye wanna know...---.conclusion:..these hands best speakers i've ever hooked pc... owned many past - trust, cambridge soundworks, 1byone, edifier e10bt, creative t20ii, creative t40ii (amazing much like dinosaurs, go like jurassic park","presonus eris are better than any small bookshelf speakers i've tried!. picked last week £69 another place honestly can't believe quality these. reviews accurate, minimalistic light. clear presentation sparkly treble tightly controlled bass, sensitive not worry also high freq low freq controls means adjust 6db plus minus rear main (l) speaker...for personally different live flat, actually turned bass -1 -2db sound great hooked somewhat antique fiio e7 dac/amp wolfson 8740 audiophile level chip via 3.5mm rca loops uk audio cables. sound signature synergy combo musical, great definition sense space. also tried xtrempro x1 ess sabre 9023 dac (available amazon £34 shipped think), sound synergy pretty cold, rather forward aggressive still decent soundstage. definitely analytical, however gets fatiguing someone like listens music 2+ hours day!..edit (14/05): upgraded slightly thin l/r stock speaker wire get box much reliable 250~ strand shielded cotton filled 99.9% ofc copper wire feel like definite differnce hey hooked today placebo. aint going back stock cable thats sure!..i also getting 3.5mm 6.35mm lr interconnect cable (not balanced) use trs inputs test see audio quality improves changes. report back soon! keep eye wanna know...---.conclusion:..these hands best speakers i've ever hooked pc... owned many past - trust, cambridge soundworks, 1byone, edifier e10bt, creative t20ii, creative t40ii (amazing much like dinosaurs, go like jurassic park",5,Positive,2020,5,11
