and not cheap. i guess i should have dropped the idea of ""pc speakers"" long ago...so, after putting up with the ""ok"" creative labs effort (don't get me started on the eu power saving garbage), and getting into the habit of perma-wearing headphones. i finally decided to check out 'studio monitors' and was about to 'reluctantly' (have you seen the price) pull the trigger on a pair of yamaha hs5's when i saw a review of those compared to the presonus e3.5...well at circa a 25% of the price of the yamaha's, i didn't take much convincing. the presonus arrived about 2 hours ago and they will not be going back. i just can't believe that they were less than the price of the creative labs 'efforts' i bought last year...mostly i listen to classical and binge watch streaming services, which seems to really suit these type of monitors, much like the reference headphones i mentioned earlier...i'm no sound guru, but to me they sound 'perfect'. as for the looks, yes they are plain matt black, well i want to hear them not see them, and no rgb, shame ;-)..as for accessories, they come with a power lead (no separate power brick, thankfully) and cables (mini jack to mini jack, mini jack to left/right phono, and some speaker wire) that will get most people up and running, also some acoustic pads to stick to the base or side...mine are on their side under the screen on my desk, and..well if you have any doubts after reading other reviews or watching youtube reviews, don't. unless your happy to pull the trigger on those yamaha hs5's i'd look no further than here...i'll certainly be recommending these to friends and colleagues...p.s. ...and they don't go to sleep at the drop of a hat like the creative speakers do, so no more missing reminders.",".....for the money they are amazing. i'll try that again, 'they are amazing'.","have been trying to get decent pc speakers for ages, have managed to get decent headphones (akg k612 pro), but never decent speakers. the last set i ""upgraded"" to were creative gigaworks t40 series ii (2.0), and they were ""ok"", and not cheap. i guess i should have dropped the idea of ""pc speakers"" long ago...so, after putting up with the ""ok"" creative labs effort (don't get me started on the eu power saving garbage), and getting into the habit of perma-wearing headphones. i finally decided to check out 'studio monitors' and was about to 'reluctantly' (have you seen the price) pull the trigger on a pair of yamaha hs5's when i saw a review of those compared to the presonus e3.5...well at circa a 25% of the price of the yamaha's, i didn't take much convincing. the presonus arrived about 2 hours ago and they will not be going back. i just can't believe that they were less than the price of the creative labs 'efforts' i bought last year...mostly i listen to classical and binge watch streaming services, which seems to really suit these type of monitors, much like the reference headphones i mentioned earlier...i'm no sound guru, but to me they sound 'perfect'. as for the looks, yes they are plain matt black, well i want to hear them not see them, and no rgb, shame ;-)..as for accessories, they come with a power lead (no separate power brick, thankfully) and cables (mini jack to mini jack, mini jack to left/right phono, and some speaker wire) that will get most people up and running, also some acoustic pads to stick to the base or side...mine are on their side under the screen on my desk, and..well if you have any doubts after reading other reviews or watching youtube reviews, don't. unless your happy to pull the trigger on those yamaha hs5's i'd look no further than here...i'll certainly be recommending these to friends and colleagues...p.s. ...and they don't go to sleep at the drop of a hat like the creative speakers do, so no more missing reminders.",5,Positive,2021,9,25

or maybe it's due to a higher crossover frequency. i'm not sure. but it's also a testament to how good these monitors are. given the price, they are amazing...i have the monitors placed high up, so they're slightly above head level, tilted downwards so they're pointing directly at my head in normal sitting position. i find this sounds much better than putting them low down at desk level and tilting them upwards, presumably because there are less reflections off the desk itself...i did this by placing a pair of pixel t50 speaker stands (50cm tall, costing £50) on my desk, just behind my displays - the stands are the perfect height to hold the monitors so their front faces are just above my displays. i then used a pair of foam isolation pads to rest the monitors on and tilt them downwards at the right angle. for this i used a pair of adam hall pad eco series absorber plates, which are the right width for these monitors.","awesome monitors, everything i wanted in a pair of miniature powered speakers","these monitors are a revelation!..everything i wanted in a miniature monitor is basically provided: sounds pop out of the speakers in a three-dimensional way, there is crisp and clean treble, clear and realistic mid-range, and a very reasonable amount of bass for the size. stereo imaging is good, and i have not found them at all fatiguing to listen to...as with most other ported designs, in an untreated room at close proximity to walls, i find it's best to roll off the bass with one of the ""low cutoff"" settings at the back (80 hz or 100 hz). but even at 80 hz, there is still an adequate amount of bass produced for most scenarios, and what is there sounds tight and controlled...sometimes i've heard details on these monitors that i never noticed before when listening to the same music on larger, much more expensive monitors. i suspect that's partly due simply to the size of the cabinets - i suspect smaller speakers are going to exhibit less masking of mid-range elements by bass sounds;
