For the price these provide a perfect audio experience. Now I'm only filling a 3x3m room so hardly an auditorium but the quality is amazing. I do feel like I could do with a subwoofer for some genres but for the average listening experience, without the neighbours complaining, it's beautiful. Almost brings a tear to my eye."

However I noticed there was a fairly loud humming noise coming from the transformer...Transformers make noise by nature however it was quite loud in this sub. I believe it was being caused from the transformer vibrations resonating through the case of the sub due to a poor mount between the case and the transformer...After reading a review also mentioning this I ended up re-mounting the transformer with some anti vibration washers"

There are also numerous settings on the amp to tweak the sound to your liking. There is a bit of a noise floor, but it isn't too significant.

I have after a lot of fiddling about got my set up so that the monitors sound like much bigger speaker while minising any bass traps in the room. It's very loud.. almost too loud so thr volume on this woofer is normally in the 2% range. Better for bigger empty spaces but I'm still glad I got it."

I'm more than happy with these speakers for my rekindled bedroom studio space. Plenty of low end, high end and mid range is fine. Maybe lacks a touch in the mid range, but nothing that will do any real harm to a mix especially once you get used to them (which is the same with anything, including speakers). Definitely recommend."

I was getting ready to go out so waited to Sat morning to un-box and set the speakers up, all connected in about 10 mins and tested. Wow what a great sound from such a small pair of speakers.

I'm not an audiophile, but the quality of sound produced by the Ceres is a revelation in comparison. The speakers will still be bedding in so the sound will only improve. Very pleased with purchase."

They also have a basic \"equalizer\" (high/low), but the sound is so good that I didn't even touch it. With my previous speakers, from a famous German low-cost brand, I couldn't achieve a decent sound no matter how I set them, though they were advertised as monitor speakers..Highly recommended and well worth the price."
