    "**What is sentiment analysis?** \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, Sentiment analysis is defined as the process of mining of data, view, review or sentence to predict the emotion of the sentence through natural language processing (NLP), a branch of computer science concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. The sentiment analysis involve classification of text into three phase ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù, ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù or‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù. It analyzes the data and labels the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô and ‚Äòworse‚Äô sentiment as positive and negative respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is very helpful in a variety of applications, in this case it is used to understand the real customer feedbacks based on their comments and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "To proceed with this analysis I tried to answer different questions and to check if my assumptions were right or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the modeling point of view, different approaches were used:\n",
    "- an approach using the powerful functionalities of the library NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit - https://www.nltk.org/) with the VADER model;\n",
    "- some Machine Learning models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) along with pre-trained Deep Learning models (such as HuggingFace's RoBERTa);\n",
    "- extra: use of built pipelines for making sentiment analysis really quick and easy (this will be really useful for the streamlit sentiment analyzer webapp).\n",

       "      <td>perfect compact speakers. item came next day as promised and packaging was minimal but affective, great to see there was not excessive waste on paper !!..the speakers were very easy to connect, if you were not sure how to connect speakers there was some instructions !..to be honest for the size and price, i was very surprised. i have bang and olufsen speakers from the 90's which at the time cost ¬£300!! they are exceptional so was very dubious of the sound quality albeit they are for my son and his pc/playstation etc.. the sound was actually really sharp and the base was pretty good without any distortion or sound loss. the sound bands were pretty much together and not lost at all..whilst not exactly a match for my b&amp;o, for the price i was so surprised. the sound is so good, and their compact size allows my son to have these on his shelf above him. pretty light weight but they do not compromise on sound..all in all for the price these are a worthy buy</td>\n",

       "4   wonderful monitors. it's been some years since using any monitors as i use dt770 250's for all my audio work and wow, i'm so pleased i added these to my studio...first the sound...the sound is quite flat which is good as you can accurately eq your sound. the bass is \"even\", meaning that it's there but it's not exaggerated. the mids are very well balanced (they sound great) and the high end is also fairly well balanced and you can get some nice air and snap when eqing. for those that have the bayer dynamic dt770 250's, you'll find your headphones have more \"air\" and snap a bit more in the highs by default, the lower mids probably have a little more punch, but not much. going back and forth between the 770's and the monitors should be a similar(ish) experience...build quality and size..very petit in size, they don't take up much room. the build is absolutely fine for the price. no issues there...you have standard connections by means of speaker wire and phono to 3.5mm (unbalanced). i'd recommend using some trs to trs to help eliminate noise from emf...on the backs you also have access to bass and treble knobs to help tune the sound to your room...on the front you have the power switch and 3.5mm ports for headphones and phone so you can play music from your phone via the correct cable, usually 3.5mm to 3.5mm. just note that the headphone in isn't powerful enough to power 250ohm headphones...overall, these monitors are brilliant and well worth the price.   \n",

       "4   it's been some years since using any monitors as i use dt770 250's for all my audio work and wow, i'm so pleased i added these to my studio...first the sound...the sound is quite flat which is good as you can accurately eq your sound. the bass is \"even\", meaning that it's there but it's not exaggerated. the mids are very well balanced (they sound great) and the high end is also fairly well balanced and you can get some nice air and snap when eqing. for those that have the bayer dynamic dt770 250's, you'll find your headphones have more \"air\" and snap a bit more in the highs by default, the lower mids probably have a little more punch, but not much. going back and forth between the 770's and the monitors should be a similar(ish) experience...build quality and size..very petit in size, they don't take up much room. the build is absolutely fine for the price. no issues there...you have standard connections by means of speaker wire and phono to 3.5mm (unbalanced). i'd recommend using some trs to trs to help eliminate noise from emf...on the backs you also have access to bass and treble knobs to help tune the sound to your room...on the front you have the power switch and 3.5mm ports for headphones and phone so you can play music from your phone via the correct cable, usually 3.5mm to 3.5mm. just note that the headphone in isn't powerful enough to power 250ohm headphones...overall, these monitors are brilliant and well worth the price.   \n",
