My only gripe is (and this could be a deal breaker for some) the sound quality from the headphone socket is awful, with a significant amount of bottom end missing when compared to my audio interface headphone out. I also replaced the cheap speaker connecting cable as it is really thin and longer than I need..UPDATE: I tried the headphone socket again and it seems fine now, maybe I hadn't plugged it in all the way before."}, {"title": "DJ approval!!", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "place and date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 on 11 January 2021", "body": "Sound quality and size of speakers perfect for good quality home entertainment and more!!.Purchased for an experienced DJ and they are extremely pleased with performance."}, {"title": "Very Precise", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "place and date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 on 8 January 2021", "body": "Superb all round"}, {"title": "Excellent Monitor Speakers - Great volume, bass and build quality (Slight sound colouration though)", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "place and date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 on 7 January 2021", "body": "Great Monitors for PC or record player / sound system. Very well made and look and sound fantastic. Very powerful (120W) for the size and very impressed with the bass response. Versatile with great input and sound adjustments. Very solid units. The Left/Right switch is brilliant as you can assign the speaker depending on your socket and cable positions...However, I also have a set of Presonus Eris E 4.5 monitors and I have to say that the Eris Monitors are not as powerful but I believe the sound quality is a little better. By that I mean that you get a truer/honest/ more neutral sound. The difference isn't huge but is noticeable. So if music production is your game then I would recommend the E4.5s over the M- Audio BX-4s. I have given the M-Audio 5 stars and it 100% suits my needs as speakers for my record player. The sound colouration difference between the two is not huge and the M-Audio are by far the best you will get for \u00a3100. They look and operate like much more expensive units...If you want a really full sound, great bass, versatility and build quality, I don't think you'll do better than the M- Audio at this price point. If you are mixing, recording or producing however and want a true and uncoloured sound and you don't need endless volume, then the 2x25 Watt Eris 4.5 are by far the most superior monitors out there for under \u00a3150."}, {"title": "Excellent", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "place and date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 on 31 December 2020", "body": "Excellent for the money"}, {"title": "Worth the cost", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "place and date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 on 23 December 2020", "body": "Unbelievably beautiful sound.
