    "**What is sentiment analysis?** \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, Sentiment analysis is defined as the process of mining of data, view, review or sentence to predict the emotion of the sentence through natural language processing (NLP), a branch of computer science concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. The sentiment analysis involve classification of text into three phase ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù, ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù or‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù. It analyzes the data and labels the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô and ‚Äòworse‚Äô sentiment as positive and negative respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is very helpful in a variety of applications, in this case it is used to understand the real customer feedbacks based on their comments and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "To proceed with this analysis I tried to answer different questions and to check if my assumptions were right or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the modeling point of view, different approaches were used:\n",
    "- an approach using the powerful functionalities of the library NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit - https://www.nltk.org/) with the VADER model;\n",
    "- some Machine Learning models (KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) along with pre-trained Deep Learning models (such as HuggingFace's RoBERTa);\n",
    "- extra: use of built pipelines for making sentiment analysis really quick and easy (this will be really useful for the streamlit sentiment analyzer webapp).\n",
