The mids are very well balanced (they sound great) and the high end is also fairly well balanced and you can get some nice air and snap when EQing. For those that have the Bayer Dynamic DT770 250  \n",

The bass kept cutting out with the highs and mids at times also doing the same. Not great at all - I opted for KrK’s instead!  \n",
