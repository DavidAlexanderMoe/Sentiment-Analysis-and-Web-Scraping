    "- **what is asin?** For amazon, the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is basically the product identifier.\n",
    "- **User agents:** When scraping a website, you also need to set user-agents on every request as otherwise the website may block your requests because it knows you aren't a real user. This user agent will clearly identify your requests as coming from a web scraper, so the website can easily block you from scraping the site. User-agent found on by googling 'my user agent'.\n",
    "- **URL:** For the self.url variable i replaced the asin with the self.asin variable to make this script available for all products (given the asin of it). Note also that in the last part of the URL I left the 'pageNumber=' make it easier to iterate over all the reviews pages, that have different URLs.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **pagination** class method we use the session object created before to get the new url with the new page (obtained by concatenating the 2 strings self.url and the page number). The if means the following: if we don't find any reviews on the URL, return False (so when using this method in a loop, if its false we can break out the loop), otherwise return the response. This is going ot be really useful when lopping through many pages without knowing how many pages there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The **parse** method pulls out all the needed info, puts everything into a dictionary and that append it to a list which will return a list of many dictionaries which basically are all the reviews with their titles, star ratings and content. When runnign the code I incurred in many different errors, so i decided to put a try/except to handle these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the **save** method allows me to save the results in a json file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For selecting the needed pieces of the 'div' tag i used the CSS selector syntax for simplicity (https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/requests-html/en/latest/) thanks to the requests_html library. This allows me to use the .find() method in a much more cleaner way rather than putting the class pf the 'div' element which is usually long and more complex, so for example:\n",

The bass is \"even\", meaning that it\\'s there but it\\'s not exaggerated. The mids are very well balanced (they sound great) and the high end is also fairly well balanced and you can get some nice air and snap when EQing. For those that have the Bayer Dynamic DT770 250\\'s, you\\'ll find your headphones have more \"air\" and snap a bit more in the highs by default, the lower mids probably have a little more punch, but not much. Going back and forth between the 770\\'s and the monitors should be a similar(ish) experience...Build quality and size..Very petit in size, they don\\'t take up much room. The build is absolutely fine for the price. No issues there...You have standard connections by means of speaker wire and phono to 3.5mm (unbalanced). I\\'d recommend using some TRS to TRS to help eliminate noise from EMF...On the backs you also have access to bass and treble knobs to help tune the sound to your room...On the front you have the power switch and 3.5mm ports for headphones and phone so you can play music from your phone via the correct cable, usually 3.5mm to 3.5mm. Just note that the headphone in isn\\'t powerful enough to power 250ohm headphones...Overall, these monitors are brilliant and well worth the price.'},\n",

It was audible at low volumes which ruined the listening experience so I exchanged for another set...This second set had the EXACT same problem. I tried connecting a different bluetooth device, I tried moving the speakers to different rooms, moving electrical devices away, swapping cables around… but the noise would not disappear no matter what I tried...Really disappointing and has massively turned me away from purchasing Presonus products again...I started the returns process on 2nd May 2023, posted the item the same day, and still have not had a refund - today is 12th May 2023.

I have Bang and Olufsen speakers from the 90's which at the time cost £300!! They are exceptional so was very dubious of the sound quality albeit they are for my son and his pc/playstation etc.. the sound was actually really sharp and the base was pretty good without any distortion or sound loss. The sound bands were pretty much together and not lost at all..Whilst not exactly a match for my B&O, for the price i was so surprised. The sound is so good, and their compact size allows my son to have these on his shelf above him.

       "   'body': 'PreSonus E5BT Incredible clear sound. These reference speakers are absolutely brilliant for a desktop setup with a laptop or desktop computer. Ideal for small studios. The E5BT gives excellent sound, has lots of functionality, is easy to setup, a pleasure to use. Everything you could want is on the front of the left speaker – power, volume, line in, phones out, & BT5 that works very well – easy connect anything. The 5 inch driver gives a full clear sound & the rear port adds a solid accurate bass response. EQ as flat as a pancake. Only the left speaker is actively amped, the right is passive. The amp jumps in output to 50W in the 5’s & is better quality - the 3 & 4 inch are 25W. Uniquely there’s a TRS sub-out which is nice, so connecting a sub is quick, easy & cheap. They are rear ported so they need some space – not bang up against a brick wall. Basic acoustic modeling for the chosen speaker position is possible with controls at the rear of the speaker - see end of post for studio setup. For the lowest volumes you’ll need to cut the line volume. The freebie music software is a distraction, so don’t waste your time - get Ableton..The E5BT’s quality & clarity makes music production a dream. You can hear every detail, so every track can be picked out, modified & levels accurately set. Dump the cables supplied in the box & get some good quality SHIELDED cable connectors. TISINO make a TRS stereo splitter cable from Amazon - a good choice for a basic direct computer connection with a 3.5 jack. All line voltages should be well shielded or you risk interference, hum, crosstalk. As with all pro speakers its good practice to switch the power to the speakers - off first - on last - accidental pops & explosive cracks do damage..These are near field but it’s worth getting the 5 inch as there is no substitute for shifting lots of air – the 5’s have a full solid bass & double the amp power, so you get lots of headroom before distortion. They are good value for money. These speak'},\n",

       "   'body': \"These are near-field monitor speakers designed to have a flat frequency response. This means they need to be closer to you at near-ear height, with speaker separation dependent on distance to form that optimum triangle you complete in the recommended listening position. Unlike consumer speakers with EQ set at speaker level, these provide an uncoloured flat EQ response. This gives a more accurate representation of the input sound source, so now you can mix your audio without adding any unwanted EQ Bias. Straight out of the Box and not tuned to my room acoustics, I didn't like they were slightly Bass heavy due to the lower frequencies of sound reflecting off walls. I tweaked the Bass by -1 dB and the Treble by +1 dB, the result is now perfect for my purposes. The Bluetooth connectivity is just a convenient function for me, the front on/off switch, Volume control, Aux In and Headphones out are great design features. I recommend using the Balanced TRS inputs. The build quality of this product is excellent. Don't forget to register for software downloads and a handy setup tutorial.\"},\n",

       "   'body': 'TL;DR: don’t buy this subwoofer; it’s a terrible product that hums and hisses...I really wanted to love this subwoofer, but it’s basically unusable due to all the noise:..- it always hums when it’s powered on, even if it’s not connected to anything. Another reviewer mentioned that’s a problem with the transformer and they fixed it by adding some padding to the transformer themselves. I can’t confirm: I don’t have such technical skills and I don’t think I should be expected to fix such things myself; could be a fire hazard!.- it introduces hissing noises to my Eris 3.5 speakers when connected to my computer, even if I use an an external DAC. these speakers do not pick up noise if I connect them to my computer directly without the subwoofer..- it introduces hissing noises to my Eris 3.5 speakers when connected to my MacBook every time I use my Magic Trackpad or Magic Keyboard. Again, the Eris 3.5 speakers do not hiss if not connected through the subwoofer...I have tried resolving the issue by using a power conditioner, and by trying different combinations of devices, cables, and wall sockets, but no joy. None of my other audio products have this problem. I can only conclude that this product has some some faulty or just plain bad electronics inside, maybe the transformer or amplifier...On the rare moments I got it to work without producing too much noise (apart from the hum) for a few moments it seemed to produce good sound, although I am no audiophile.'},\n",

The Studio One software that's included with the speakers, is truly horrible to use, and with all of the plug ins and downloads, it took up, 'wait for it' 20 gig of my laptop's memory. 3 days of downloads and plug ins later, I was then able to actually start using the software, it's unbelievably unuser friendly, crashes all the time too, I imagine that's due to the huge amounts of memory it takes up on the laptop. Truthfully, I deleted 'all' of the included software and went with another online music DAW, that takes up no memory and is ultra user-friendly. But as far as the speakers go, AMAZING!!!!!\"},\n",

They're loud (surprisingly so!), compact and discreet sat next to my monitors. The sound would normally be excellent I'm sure of it, but unfortunately, the bass woofer on the right side speaker is rattling, even at lower volumes, and there's a distinct rattle when you shake the speaker, so I would assume it's a transit issue. I've mounted the speakers on isolation pads and there's nothing on my desk to cause the noise and the louder you put them, the louder the noise is, so it's definitely the speaker. My friend's setup is pretty much identical to mine, and his sound superb, so I know they're great little monitors, but it's unfortunate that mine are damaged on arrival. Not sure who to speak to about this issue either, so I'll just have to listen at extremely low volume for now until I can find out who to contact...Other than the fact that mine are broken, listening to my friend's speakers, these have a nice flat frequency response and are deserving of their #1 spot at the top of the most bought studio monitors on the Amazon lists. They're a great little set of speakers for anything from gaming, to podcasting to AV production. They're not bluetooth enabled speakers, which wasn't on my must-have list anyway, but I have them hooked up to my computer via balanced inputs taken from an iFi Zen DAC, which sounds superb in it's own right...All in all, a nice little set of super-compact speakers.

The second sub I ordered had a terrible hum which I reduced by getting the volume balanced between the Eris 4.5s and the sub and the interface for my Mac..The first sub just stopped producing bass; which I sent back no issue but the second sun was faulty and the return window much smaller. It went “pop” the day the return window closed and although a bit of a pain, going back between Amazon and PreSonus, Amazon replaced the sub...Third time is definitely a charm. The 4.5 and sub pair fantastically...I’m mainly working with Logic Pro and the clarity and depth makes production difficult because of how much fun I’m having exploring sound...The bass on this unit is deeeeeeeeeeeeep. It fills my living room and I doubt I’ll ever push the unit. Don’t think I need to...The bass is punchy, tight and kicks bottom...I’m sure many people have had an easier time and despite trouble getting this purchase off the ground I’m thrilled I finally did...If you’re interested in the monitor sub combo, be assured it’s great...Once again, I’m using the Eris 4.5 (not BT) and Sub 8 and for 300 you’d be pushed to find better...Frankly amazing it’s this clear and powerful at that price.'},\n",

       "   'body': \"I saw these speakers on a YouTuber's desk setup and he was raving about them. So I figured I'd give them a bash...I was using the built in speaker on my Macbook or my monitor. Both I found were similar in quality and I felt sound was OK. Nothing spectacular but I felt OK given I'm not a audiophile. It gets the job done and I can listen to YouTube and Spotify OK...So I was curious how I would find the speakers and if I'd resent the extra space it takes on my desk. I've spent a lot of time/money making the desk as minimal as possible. So to plonk two speakers on the desk felt a little unnecessary. I didn't want to spend crazy money so these speakers seemed to fit the bill...When they arrived I carefully opened the box, unwrapped everything and plugged everything in. Half convinced they'd be returned soon. I turned them on, loaded up a music video on YouTube.......And BOOM! Instantly I realised these speakers would NOT be going back. The sound quality is incredible! The music just came alive, I could hear so much more!..I love the styling of them, simple and understated. The front power button makes it easy for me to turn on/off without having to reach around the back...Sound is not bass heavy like some headphones I've used in the past. This is important as sometimes my wife edits video so we need accuracy on the sound...I'm really struggling to think of anything negative to say so I won't!..At this price, they are an absolute STEAL! Just get them and be happy!\"},\n",

       "   'body': 'I\\'ve only just connected these speakers to my PC (for music, streaming, etc as opposed to gaming) so these are my first impressions...The sound is pretty good for the speaker size. There is good bass without it being overwhelming (I\\'ve increased the bass slightly). I was slightly worried before buying them that I might need to buy a separate cable to connect to my PC, but this proved not to be the case - everything was included (though the instructions were not - see below)...There are a few things that could be improved on:..1. Perhaps they are not the best looking speakers - at first I thought there were a bit \"boxy\" and square, but I\\'ve changed my mind and quite like their chunkiness. However, for a desktop set up it would be better to have them angled upwards...2. The volume control doesn\\'t have any markings so you can\\'t tell how far you\\'ve turned it apart from the sound - it would be better to have a visual marker...3. Bass and treble controls (for some reason PreSonus don\\'t refer to them as bass and treble which are terms everyone understands!) are awkwardly located at the back of the left speaker...4. Documentation is pretty poor. The Startup Guide and User Guide (neither of which were in the box - I had to register the product to get them) is no help for anyone with no specialist audio skills just hooking up to a PC: it doesn\\'t show how to do this, and the terminology might be fine for sound engineers and dedicated gamers but not for your average PC user. I had to look for online tutorials to take me through it step by step...These small reservations aside, I\\'m very happy with them.'},\n",

It is not particularly loud but it is present regardless of if the volume is turned all the way down or not, and above around 70% volume the hiss gets louder. It is not affected by any adjustments to volume from the source (PC) and the hiss is still present even when there are no cables other than the power attached...That being said, I do not know whether this is normal for a pair of speakers like this. I upgraded from a pair of Creative Gigaworks T40 speakers, which had a noticeable hum and hiss above 50% volume. This hiss from these PreSonus Eris E4.5 BT speakers is much quieter and it took me about 3 days to even notice it. I am sensitive to what might be considered to be annoying noises, but I do not consider the hiss to be particularly obnoxious or annoying - in fact, with my tinnitus it is almost comforting. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but this is still something potential buyers may wish to know and consider before committing to purchasing these speakers...As for the quality of the audio from these speakers, they really are a huge step up from the aforementioned Creative T40s. It seemed at first that there wasn't much bass, but after turning up the low end frequencies on the acoustic tuning controls I can say with confidence that these speakers can produce ample amounts of bass. Just keep in mind that adjusting these controls can defeat the point of using the speakers as reference monitors since certain frequencies will become enhanced or stifled depending on how you set them...Overall a great pair of speakers, only marred by the quiet hiss that I now find impossible not to notice. Not a dealbreaker for me, though, and I'm still satisfied with them for the price.\"},\n",

I think they perform fairly well both for music listening and movies/videogames, while they still give you a lot of information if you want to do some music production. Not bad at all, considering they are as tiny as 3.5\" speakers can get, saving you a lot of space on your desk...Apart from sounding great, they pack some nice features that are not that easy to find at this category. Things like optional TRS outputs, kevlar woofer, aux-in and headphones ports really make the Eris 3.5 stand out from most budget speakers. The two EQ knobs on the back for fixing some audio space related issues are also a welcome addition...I know it might be much to ask at this price, but the included pads could be a bit thicker. I am also missing an auto power-saving mode like the KRK\\'s, or at least an option to turn off the power LED. I went for the 3.5\\'\\' because I really wanted the smaller possible, but they obviously come with some limitations when it comes to sound, especially on the lower frequencies. I would strongly suggest looking at the 4.5\" ones (or bigger) if space is not an issue or if they are to be used exclusively for music production...In a nutshell, if you want small speakers on a budget that still stay relatively accurate and sound great, this is probably your best bet.'},\n",

I didn’t measure any of the leads but most of them are about 1.5m and the speaker wire is about 1.8m. The speaker wire is nothing special, no propitiatory plugs on the end, so easy to replace if you need something longer...I bought these as a pair of computer speakers. Having tried a number of different makes, I wanted something that didn’t mess with the sound so much. These are just great. Very neutral. Of course they are best for music. With games, it really doesn’t matter much what speakers you use, they all sound pretty good. Who knows what the game is supposed to sound like anyway? With movies and so on, they sound good but I generally find that any source on the internet sounds “not that great” and the speakers are capable of something more...I like the addition of a mains switch on the front, volume control, LED and a few sockets for input (aux) and output (headphones). It’s particularly useful to be able to set the max volume on the knob and just leave it alone – using the computer volume from there on. The LED is relatively dim so unobtrusive, especially from any other angle other that dead on...The speakers use eight watts doing nothing and mine refused to go in to standby mode. I sat there for two hours and nothing. Now I know that eight watts is not much but my speakers needed to be on twenty four hours a day which adds up to seventy kilowatt hours per year. That's hopeless. I don't want to deduct a star for that but just be warned, you really need to turn them off! Some people complained about the standby so perhaps they have disabled it now? Don't know. Couldn't find any information about that...I compared these directly to a pair of Edifier, and I have to say that the Edifier were probably better for most people.

As a temporary measure I set up the Dell PC speakers that had come with the system, and was shocked at how bad they were were! I was about to buy the Z607 speaker system, as being the nearest direct replacement to the Z506, when I spotted a recommendation on the Internet to try the PreSonus Eris E3.5 instead. I was a bit dubious about \"downgrading\" to just stereo speakers, but I had long stopped using the rear speakers of the Z506 as they didn\\'t give true surround sound and locating them correctly and running the wires safely was always a problem. Also, I rarely had the subwoofer turned up that rapidly gained complaints from the rest of the family! Anyway, the Eris speakers are very easy to setup, the sound is as good - if not better - than the old Z506, and general setup is tidier, with no sub-woofer or centre speaker. If you are demanding music connoisseur or have a high-end gaming rig then look else where, but for the average home user looking for a simple solution that will provide decent but not exceptional sound at a relatively low price - definitely an option to consider seriously.'},\n",

       "   'body': \"So I think these are the cheapest single bit of audio equipment I own. I wanted something to use at my desktop for monitoring my guitar playing without breaking the bank...I have a £600 hifi setup, good IEM's and open back headphones, and all things considered I think these are really good value for money...Resolution (ability for them to reproduce detail in music).- Good (for the money). You won't be able to discern lossy vs lossless music with these. Not even close. However they hold their own. The detail in the midrange is pretty good. High end clarity is lost a little. For the money, I'd not expect much more than this...Range of frequencies.- Well, they're 3-inch monitors. Of course they wont produce floor shaking sub-bass. For example in Billy Eilish - Your Power. The sub bass wubwub bits starting at 2.45 are barely audible, or at least there is no weight to the sound at all...Tuning.- It seems pretty 'flat' to me for the frequencies it produces, however, of course this is nowhere near a full-range sound (as discussed above) so it lacks the majority of bass below 60Hz...Soundstage and imaging (the ability for them to place certain sounds in space - front, back, left, right, up, down).- is fairly poor, narrow, however to be expected. This is something you only relly get with much more expensive speakers.- Front/back and up/down imaging is where it falls off. There isnt much depth to the soundstage either. Again, I must reiterate I wouldn't expect this at £89...Power (volume).- More than enough for any kind of small-medium room desktop listening which this is designed for. Not a hifi system / room filling sound. But perfect for desktop use...Connectivity.- Excellent. Whole range of options. Personally I run from my audiointerface into the back using RCA or TRS and it works just fine. The idea of a powered and slave speaker makes more sense at this price...Build quality.- Great. I wouldn't really ask for any more than this at £89. It's honestly quite impressive. T\"},\n",

Although I'll keep a hold of the T40s as a spare set, I'll be getting rid of the T100s as I was never satisfied with them.

There are also numerous settings on the amp to tweak the sound to your liking. There is a bit of a noise floor, but it isn't too significant. I would definitely recommend this subwoofer to anyone looking for a budget option that still sounds great.\"},\n",

       "   'body': 'After all the positive reviews about this product, I was so much looking forward to hooking this Sub up to my system. However, I was at first very disappointed with the sound quality in general, because it did not deliver the window rattling, lound, punchy, low-end base like some other reviewers had suggested it did! Having said that, the addition of this Sub will actually drastically improve the overall low end frequencies when paired with the somewhat base-shy PreSonus E3.5 Satellite Speakers. For this reason I have to recommend this Sub, but please don\\'t expect ear shatteringly loud, punchy low end base because you won\\'t get it! I have my system hooked up to my PC in a small office space just 5\\'x10\\' & mainly play music and I need both the Sub & Speakers set to almost max!.Both HPF & 180 deg. swithes located on the rear of the unit make no difference to the sound whatsoever which is a little disappointing & the volume control is also located on the back which some people may also find a tad inconvenient..I was shocked when playing just the Sub on its own (satellite speakers turned off) because the lower frequency base notes sounded not only very quiet, but muffled & distorted too! I was hoping for nice loud punchy low end base but didn\\'t get it! Having said that - when played together with the satellite speakers the overall sound does seem to come life!.Don\\'t be put off by this review because the overall sound is pretty good for the money & its usually true in what they say - \"you get what you pay for\"!'},\n",

Could be a little longer but long enough for most desks...The volume can go very loud without losing too much quality. Louder than i will ever need...These are meant more for music people who want to hear things more accurately. This means that for music production the are pretty good but some things and voices in practically sound a bit off...They are okay for gaming as they have good bass and good sound quality although again, some things do sound a little off...Most of these things are not that noticeable if you are not listing out for it though...They also angle sound very \"straight\". By this i mean if you are directly in front of the speakers they are very loud but if you step to the side you can notice a drop in volume. Sound obvious but its more noticeable than with other speakers that i have used...All in all i think they are pretty good for the price and very good if you are using them for electric instruments or music production.'},\n",

However, if you're after something with a bit more kick in a slightly larger room then you should probably go for the 4.5 inch version as the 3.5 inch version really lack bass. I love the 3.5 inch version of the speakers but it does lack volume, they don't go very loud so if you're recording at low volume in your DAW software playback will lack the volume that you so desire. The sound quality is good though...Update:.Just under a week and they're broken, there's a fuzzy noise coming from the left cone when a certain bass frequency has hit and it sounds garbage now!!!!\"},\n",

The tweeters provide really great rendition on all sorts of cymbals and the set up picks up all guitars, pianos, violins and cellos, brass, reed and vocals and provides a remarkably authentic, clipping free level of fidelity for their price and size...If they have a failing, it’s in low end bass. Anyone expecting too much of that from a 3.5” mid/bass, may be somewhat optimistic...I matched these units with an existing sub unit and the overall sound quality is outstanding for the price. The 3.5s bottom out at 80Hz. Bear that in mind. On their own they are superior to many desktop speakers, but you need a sub if you want a full ‘sound stage’...There was some buzzing on install. The supplied cables are - adequate. I thought I might have to invest in some better (shielded) ones. However, judicious positioning of the power and input cables solved the problem...Would I recommend these? Yes. I don’t know what comes near them at their price.'},\n",

       "   'body': \"Firstly I'll point out I get absolutely no mains hum from these whatsoever but studio monitors are sensitive to it. I had massive problems with my Adams caused by a duff mains adaptor. It'll usually be either from the leads or other devices plugged into same mains block. If possible give these they're own socket. Lamps can be trouble if in same socket. TV seems fine in same block. Upgrading interconnect cables also helps a lot. Mine are 50 quid and that's overkill but 20 or 30 should do. The supplied ones are really low end sub 5 pound cables and don't do the speakers justice. Got these as an upgrade from the Pioneer DM40s. I have a set of Adam audio studio monitors upstairs and everytime I listened in my lounge I found the sound good but underwhelming. Have these connected up to the TV and use for TV and music. They are much more immersive and higher clarity than the Pioneers. Soundstage comes out much further. Like having separate bass and treble controls too to tweak the sound. Music videos come to life. They're not as good as the Adams but they are an extra 100 and bigger too and more professional. For 160 I paid for these they are great. Treble is clear, sound is lively and fun. Bass is good for the size of the speaker. Good in my relatively small lounge. Rear ported so keep away from walls or cover the ports if that's not possible .\"},\n",

I decided to purchase these speakers and i must say im very impressed! I wanted some speakers for music production and DJing but was a little apprehensive as i heard the bass on these are not as deep as the others and I am very much a person who loves my bass. These speakers pack a punch and carry a good bass, obviously you want get a deep ground rumbling bass but it does have enough bass to hear and feel and great clarity which is a must when producing music. They are also surprisingly loud, louder than i expected. The bass does get a bit distorted when cranked right up which is to be expected. The sound easily fills the room and is ideal if your a bedroom producer/DJ or to just play songs on.'},\n",

I ordered some M4 10mm x 15mm rubber mounts from amazon and mounted the transformer with them. I added a silicone tubing to hang under the transformer for added support. I thought I had done something wrong because when I turned it on I thought it wasn't working because it was silent.

Everything I'd hoped for and more...Value for money, without doubt, sound quality is way above the price paid. I'd recommend these to anyone, for a number of reasons...Home studio, yes perfect.

No hum, imperceptible hiss even with the volume turned right up, and both channels are equally loud...Connected by unbalanced RCA cables to my Focusrite Scarlett 2i4, the sound is clear with as much bass as you\\'d expect from such small woofers and plenty of treble. The midrange is good with reasonable amounts of detail. When used as desk-mounted near-field speakers, volume levels are very adequate...The EQ controls on the back of the left-hand (master) speaker are of limited use. I found little point in adjusting the bass control as turning it up just made the sound confused and flabby without actually making it go any deeper. If you want lots of deep bass from small speakers then adding a subwoofer is the only way to go. However, the rather splashy treble does benefit from being turned down a bit as these speakers are plenty bright...As for whether they are \"monitors\"; no, not really. They are decent-sounding desktop speakers at a fair price that are a huge improvement on cheap plastic ones, but they\\'re too bright for reliable mixing and mastering, and would tend to create a a mix that would sound dull on other, more balanced speakers, and would also be quite hopeless for setting bass levels correctly...One last positive comment - there\\'s no automatic turn-off after an inactive period as one sees with many powered speakers, so there\\'s less risk of missing an alert because your speakers have decided to go into power-saving mode.'},\n",

       "   'body': \"I had been looking at these for awhile before I took the plunge - and I'm very glad I bought them!..For many years I had used the Bose Companion set of speakers with a small subwoofer connected to my PC. They were a bit overpriced but sounded great...When the control unit packed up on them I was struggling to find a worthy replacement. Like another reviewer, I tried the Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II - they were awful! Not a very clear sound at all and no matter how I adjusted thyem they were swamped with a muddy mid sound. Although I'm not a music producer I do like to be able to hear my music clearly and these little units do the trick very well indeed...Quick and easy to unpack and install, the pads to isolate them from whatever you stand them on are a very nice addition. I connected them to my computer and immediately noticed what I'd been missing...I will probably use the tuning controls on the back to get them exactly how I want them but even without doing that, the audio quality and soudstage are really very good. I'd say money well spent on these units...I listen to a very wide range of music styles and genres, so far they all sound great.\"}],\n",

       "   'body': \"I bought these in a rush as the power socket broke on my trusty (and very old) Roland MA-10s broke. In an ideal world I would have gone for the KRK ones to replace but I just don't have that kind of scratch right now and I really couldn't wait, I had stuff I needed to do and didn't want to waste even a single day. These arrived the next day which was really impressive...At first when they arrived I was disappointed. They looked really cheap and plasticky and were nowhere near as solid as the (mdf) Rolands. I almost thought about sending them back tbh, they just didn't look like they were up to the job. I saw how they are referred to as 'multimedia monitors' and not 'studio monitors' on the box and got that sinking feeling that I'd wasted my money......I decided to plug them in and listen to them. At first they didn't sound that pleasant. Its a very 'active' sound, very blown up and unnatural. But I compared it to my Rolands and A/B'd them for a while and conditioned my ears to the new sound and then started to realise how bad the Rolands actually were. They were so fizzy and boomy in comparison, the mids seemed scooped too, they were masking all kinds of problems. On these I could straight away notice some quite major flaws in the low and high ends of the track i was working on which wasn't apparent before. People are saying they are no good for below 80Hz (which figures with such small cones) but tbh I've been quite impressed with the bass response so far. I would say 80-120Hz is actually very clear. For the sub bass I would use headphones anyway, seriously these seem fine for audio use...I have a full size pair of Roland DS-7s which cost a few hundred quid which I absolutely love and they don't compare to those at all. I actually like listening to music on those where as these are just a tool. These will be my convenient, low volume, day to day monitors...But yeah I'm very happy with these.

They sound pretty good now...But to my ears, they didn\\'t before tinkering.....The cases are 1/4\" MDF, sound very resonant when knocked, and could be felt to move due to bass notes. This colours the sound quite a bit with a sort of boxy boomy nonsense going in the upper bass/lower male voice region...To cure them, opened them up and added sound-deadening mat to the walls as well as a few small cross braces. Fun opening the right-hand speaker is it\\'s glued together. So carefully cut the back off using the table saw...You can probably accomplish most of this by turning them on their sides and putting a pile of books on them to stops the sides from vibrating...The port still seems set slightly high. Presumably to get a flat (or slight rise in bass response as that sells). I prefer a slight roll-off, so printing short flared extensions for the ports for the inside of the cabinet. In essence, I\\'m after the response somewhere between blocked ports and the as purchased response. So lengthening it a bit will lower the resonance and also slightly scupper the coupling...The amp within them is a TDA 7265 to save anyone screwdriver effort to get there - also not very \"studio\"...In conclusion, they\\'re not studio quality monitors at all. Can\\'t even be bothered to get out the test gear for them. But fun as a Sunday project to buy dinky speakers and get them working a little better was pleasing. They work well with my headphones, which automatically switch over to the speakers when turned off. And now the case resonances are out the way of human voices will be great for conference calls and a bit of Spotify while working...Giving 3/5 as not good enough to be monitors, being that they colour the sound too much in stock form. But not 0, as were fun to play with and are now fixed. I didn\\'t need monitors.

The last set I \"upgraded\" to were Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II (2.0), and they were \"ok\", and not cheap. I guess I should have dropped the idea of \"PC speakers\" long ago...So, after putting up with the \"ok\" Creative Labs effort (don\\'t get me started on the EU power saving garbage), and getting into the habit of perma-wearing headphones. I finally decided to check out \\'studio monitors\\' and was about to \\'reluctantly\\' (have you seen the price) pull the trigger on a pair of Yamaha HS5\\'s when I saw a review of those compared to the PreSonus E3.5...Well at circa a 25% of the price of the Yamaha\\'s, I didn\\'t take much convincing. The PreSonus arrived about 2 hours ago and they will NOT be going back. I just can\\'t believe that they were less than the price of the Creative Labs \\'efforts\\' I bought last year...Mostly I listen to classical and binge watch streaming services, which seems to really suit these type of monitors, much like the reference headphones I mentioned earlier...I\\'m no sound guru, but to me they sound \\'perfect\\'. As for the looks, yes they are plain matt black, well I want to hear them not see them, and no RGB, shame ;-)..As for accessories, they come with a power lead (no separate power brick, thankfully) and cables (mini jack to mini jack, mini jack to left/right phono, and some speaker wire) that will get most people up and running, also some acoustic pads to stick to the base or side...mine are on their side under the screen on my desk, and..Well if you have any doubts after reading other reviews or watching YouTube reviews, don\\'t. Unless your happy to pull the trigger on those Yamaha HS5\\'s I\\'d look no further than here...I\\'ll certainly be recommending these to friends and colleagues...p.s. ...and they don\\'t go to sleep at the drop of a hat like the Creative speakers do, so no more missing reminders.'},\n",

       "   'body': 'I was a bit worried about purchasing these as there are quite a few reviews complaining about mains hum and hiss. I can report that you can hear a hiss only if you put your ear up to the speaker, that you will get with all active speakers, you get a mild buzzing sound from the left one when you are connected with Bluetooth. These are both very minor and nothing to worry about (I am very fussy). The majority of bad reviews I think are relating to the older version of these. Presonus seem to have addressed the problem quite well with this newer version..The most important thing is the sound and I think that these sound fantastic for the money. I have been a so called audiophile for the last 45 years and I have spent way more money than this on passive speakers that don’t sound as good..Regarding the sound, I am using these for listening to music not for mixing or production. These are near field monitors which means that you sit only a few feet away from them to get the best sound, they will fill most rooms not a problem but the best sound is found when you sit close to them..Because these are designed to be uses in a studio the sound is not emphasised at all, you get a pretty flat frequency response. With these speakers poor recordings sound poor and great recordings sound great. All in all I am really happy with these.'},\n",

Yet despite this they still provide a comfortable listening experience when being used for non professional tasks...The speakers are able to push an impressive volume for there small size, however they are still monitors, don't expect them to fill a large room with sound. The amplifier's are very quiet with no audible hiss or hum from the speakers even in a silent room (also with the inputs disconnected)..The one gripe I have with these speakers is they have a bright blue power LED on the front above the volume knob. This is unfortunate as it is very annoying in a darkened room, however is easily remedied with a small square of black electrical tape...For this price I would recommend these to anyone, with professional monitors this cheap most computer speaker manufacturers (logitech) should probably just give up.\"},\n",

I use them wired when using cubase as the audio comes out via a steinberg ur242 usb audio interface and so use phono leads to take the audio from the ur242. When gaming I use them via bluetooth and the family have paired their phones so they can play their tunes. The speakers were playing within 2 minutes of unboxing, no issues at all. It's handy having the volume on the front and also handy having headphones out on the front as it means I can monitor there when recording if someone else is using the headphone out from the ur242 to records vocals. The sound is punchy and very clear up to quite loud volumes. Play them at full volume and you might get a little distortion from the bass but hey, they're tiny! THe EQ can be tweaked (bass and treble) which is handy or just leave them at 0 if you want a more accurate sound when recording. I'm really glad a spent just a few quid more to get the Bluetooth version and if you're going to be sharing these with the rest of the household like I am then go for that option. If you have a dedicated space for home recording (lucky you!) then the wired version would be fine.\"},\n",

Of course, I know sound is subjective and some will love that kind of bass but I am pretty sure I could make a better pair from a cornflake box, it’s also worth saying that the PreSonus Eris E3.5 are priced as a budget pair of PC speakers and cost very little and I understand that there are also limiting factors like the PC sound card, but unfortunately, I can’t recommend them due to their boomy uncontrolled bass.'},\n",

Good for listening to Spotify and revealing enough for mixing and recording. They fir nicely on my desk either side of my Dell LCD screen and fill the room perfectly, no distortion just clarity. I added an old sub woofer via a splitter and use if i want more bass, but to be honest they don't really need it for most genres. Excellent\"},\n",

My thoughts purchasing the E3.5BT was that they'll have a similar, if not the same sound profile as the E4.5s. How wrong I was...The sound on the E3.5BT is thinner, lacking significantly in the mid-range. The highs are excellent due to the 1 inch tweeter found in both versions. The lows are excellent as well, but not as punchy as the E4.5s...The build quality of both speakers is phenomenal for the price. Don't think you can get a better deal for Kevlar woven speakers at this price point...I read a lot of comments about AC (Mains) Hum. My E3.5BT unit did exhibit AC humming at high volume (~>70%). However, its not audible at lower volumes which is absolutely great. You can set the volume at a lower level on the speakers and crank up the volume at the source (PC, Phone, Tablet etc). I do also have to mention that there's a white background noise, barely audible for it to be a worrying factor...Bluetooth 5.0 is a great addition as well. Pairs and connects with no issues. However it doesn't support codecs such as aptX-HD or LDAC. Only got SBC to work on my Android phone...In conclusion, the E3.5BT is great if you're upgrading from a basic setup. I think you'll absolutely enjoy these speakers. However I do believe the E4.5s sound better. Better lows and mids...Too bad my plan didn't work. I'm keeping my E4.5s and returning the E3.5BT. I don't think I can give up the sound quality for a few square cm of desk space. I'm going to try the Audioengine A2+ next.\"},\n",

       "   'body': \"When I first got these speakers, I really didn't like them..1. The bass was boomy making the low and mid all a bit 'muddy'. Checking on the Presonus FAQs it is recommended to keep the speakers away from the walls by 4 feet (1.5ft mentioned elsewhere) because of the rear port, so I pulled them forward and the boomy muddyness had gone, delivering a balanced sound with detail and punch. I was thinking of adding a subwoofer but I'm not going to bother - I like the sound as is (obviously these speakers won't shake the room)..2. There is a background hiss when using bluetooth, higher than when using the RCA inputs. Presonus helped by suggesting turning the source (e.g. your phone) to maximum volume and turning down the volume on the speakers. The hiss is now low enough not to be noticeable in normal use..3. The bluetooth mostly doesn't reconnect to previously paired devices. I have to press the pair button every time I turn the speakers on.4. The volume isn't the highest. These are advertised ' It may be small but the E3.5 is loud, as well as clear' but don't expect anything like your home Hifi with 50W amp. I don't turn my home hifi up much at all (not after annoying the neighbors) but these need turning up much more. But they are near field monitors not DJ speakers...On balance, I love these speakers. Great detailed balanced sound. Ideal for streaming 6 music at my desk while working from home without disturbing the rest of the house. Bluetooth could be better but good enough for my use, no way good enough for music production (but then you wouldn't be using bluetooth anyway)...PS no problems with mains hum as some report. This is probably because I've not wired them to another piece of mains equipment which creates ground loops.\"},\n",

In my case, they're hooked up to a computer with an ESS 9038-based DAC and mostly used for gaming and general media consumption...Lossless audio formats like .flac and even high-quality .mp3's sound absolutely spot on! Even with the volume cranked up, highs are crisp and clear, and the mid-range is natural-sounding with lovely definition. The low-ends and bass are more punchy than deep, which is no surprise for bookshelf-sized monitors, but that's not a bad thing. Highs, mids and lows are clean and clearly distinguishable with minimal overlapping or bleeding. In any case, a dedicated sub woofer could always be added for those who require more of a boomy or rumbly bass sound to their set-up...Out of the box I found that the highs were a bit too prominent for my taste, but was easily rectifiable using the tone control located on the rear of the left speaker. In any case, I tend to run different audio profiles (EQ settings) from the source (a computer) depending on what I'm doing or listening to...Having had the Eris E4.5's sat on my desk for ~ 2 months now, I would happily recommend them to anyone looking for affordable, high-quality speakers for their set-up.\"},\n",

And listening to punk through these and the music almost vanishes completely and leaves just the vocals, like they are some kind of reverse karaoke machine!...Then using the headphone socket at low volumes and all i get is a loud hum, but when i turned these and my DAW up until it was totally in the red i could still ONLY JUST hear it....But when i plugged these in to the headphone socket of my TV and watched ''Dune'' for the millionth time it sounded better than ever.

They’re too big to use as PC speakers (for most people) but don’t sound any better than most of the so-called ‘premium’ PC speakers available for less money. Warning to anyone who actually knows what good speakers sound like: you will not like these for any purpose apart from listening to Radio 4 occasionally...I wondered how they could make a good powered monitor for 85 quid.

       "   'body': \"These monitors are an absolute steal at this price, the original 3.5 are still selling out everywhere! Nothing else at this price or below even comes close to the quality of sound and versatility of these amazing industrial looking boxes!..1 inch silk-dome tweeters are just something else on these beauties - the resolution, the extra wide sweetspot, the soundstage is all taken care of here. Of course it's even covered with a small metal grate so fingers can't ruin them! Bottom line, these tweeters are way better than anything I've ever experienced before... and I've had a LOT of different speakers...Not to forget about the 3.5 inch woven Kevlar woofer finished off in dark blue/navy shade just adds such a touch of class. If you have natural light shining into your room/studio it just bounces off so nicely. Won't improve the sound but definitely makes these ERIS monitors feel even more high quality. Even down to the PreSonus badge, it really looks like it got some attention to detail. The AB amps are super quiet to turn on and operate, there's plenty of power at 25W per side for a medium sized studio room. I haven't even turned the volume knob past 35% at this point and I've had all the volume I needed so far!..I'm running mine from a decade old Behringer UCA222 audio interface with the TI PCM2902E DAC chip via RCA to TRS cables - swapping L/R inputs to make sure the powered monitor is on the right due to preference. Out of the box the active speaker is the left one, so remember that you can swap RCA/TRS if you wish!..Conclusion - Don't let the price fool you! These are a quality product, and I'm almost convicted with all the R&D that's gone into these boxes PreSonus are probably loosing money on each pair that they sell!!..The only con is the included speaker to speaker wire is a bit naff, but I picked up 3m of 99% OFC copper speaker wire from fleabay and couldn't be happier. It has cotton shielding and better transmission than stock wire. You can see it in the pictu\"},\n",

So i got hold of a pair of Creative T10s. They were ok but not an enjoyable listen. Next was the £129.99 Edifier R1700bt. Solidly built and well made. Aweful sound though Bass way to boomy for starters Turn it down and it kills whatever youre listening to. So reading reviews like youre doing now i went looking again for a pair of speakers. It was my opinion id be wasting my time buying desktop speakers and decided i was going to buy monitors instead. So i was looking at so many brands, reading reviews here and on the internet. Well i settled to buy these Presonus eris 3.5. Had them going for hours now. The soundstage is fantastic for such a small of speakers. The bass is sweet and the mids and highs clear. Sure my Tannoys are better sounding during the daytime hours and running from my Arcam avr amp i can make my flat shake. however these for their money are well worth it and i am happy with my purchase.

       "   'body': \"Picked these up last week for £69 from another place and honestly can't believe the quality of these. All reviews are accurate, these are as minimalistic as they are light. They have a very clear presentation with sparkly treble and tightly controlled bass, but if you're sensitive to that not to worry because they also have High Freq and Low Freq controls which means you can adjust it by up to 6db plus or minus on the rear of the main (L) speaker...For me personally it's different because I live in a flat, I actually turned down the bass by -1 to -2db and they sound great hooked up to my somewhat antique FiiO E7 DAC/AMP with a Wolfson 8740 audiophile level chip via 3.5mm to RCA Loops UK audio cables. Sound signature and synergy from this combo is very musical, with great definition and sense of space. I also tried it with an XtremPro X1 ESS Sabre 9023 DAC (available here on Amazon for about £34 shipped I think), and the sound synergy is pretty cold, rather forward and aggressive but still with decent soundstage. Definitely more analytical, however this gets fatiguing for someone like me who listens to music for 2+ hours a day!..EDIT (14/05): I have upgraded the slightly thin L/R stock speaker wire that you get in the box to a much more reliable 250~ strand shielded cotton filled 99.9% OFC copper wire and I feel like there is a definite differnce but hey I only hooked it up today so it could be just placebo. I aint going back to the stock cable thats for sure!..I will also be getting a 3.5mm to 6.35mm LR interconnect cable (not balanced) so I can use the TRS inputs and test to see if the audio quality improves or changes. Will report back here soon! Keep an eye out if you wanna know...---.Conclusion:..These are hands down the best speakers I've ever had hooked up to my PC... AND I have owned many in the past - Trust, Cambridge Soundworks, 1ByOne, Edifier E10BT, Creative T20ii, Creative T40ii (AMAZING but very much like dinosaurs, go for them if you like Jurassic Park\"},\n",

Until I got a Fiio K3 amp/dac and didn\\'t think they did it justice, so I started my search for upgraded monitors.....Enter the Tibo Plus 1.1 (which cost more than these), but I found them to be too thin, harsh. They were more detailed than the T40s, but lacking any body to the sound and very shrill at even moderate volume ( I tried to get used to them, but I just couldnt).....So the search continued and I ordered these.... straight forward setup, all cables I required were provided..... 5 seconds in to some Toto, I just grinned with delight, 2 hours later I was still going through my favourites playlist songs thinking... \"I wonder how that song will sound on these?\" ..... the answer was wonderful every time. Rock, Rap, Blues, Funk, Hip-hop, Jazz, Classical, everything I tried just sounds so good. The treble is smooth yet detailed, but not piercing or fatiguing to my ears. The mids are there, and for such small speakers I can\\'t believe the oomph these speaker pack. The bass is incredible for the size... even makes my desk vibrate (which the Gigaworks T40s couldnt even do with two woofers). Don\\'t get me wrong... it\\'s not sub bass, woofer style, but it\\'s really clear and controlled. And I\\'ve learned that the numbers mean nothing... the Tibo\\'s frequency range started at 20Hz, my Creative\\'s started at 50Hz, and these E3.5\\'s start at 80Hz.... but they have the best, cleanest, punchiest, and deepest sounding bass out of those mentioned...Nothing seems over emphasised to me, everything is \\'there\\', all sounds and frequencies... I havent felt the need to adjust them, but there are bass/treble controls should you need them. I guess that\\'s why thes'},\n",

       "   'body': 'Absolutely brilliant !!.Needed some new speakers for my home DJ’ing as had my previous ones for a number of years and felt the sound wasn’t as clear as it could be. Read the reviews and couldn’t find a bad one, and for the price thought I’d order a pair. They are small and as I have wall brackets, I did have to cut down the extendable arm on my brackets to enable them the clamp the speaker but these were existing brackets and I was gonna make them fit either way. They are probably better to sit on a desk or something which has no back, as the powered speaker has a power lead, the 2 rca connections and the speaker cable link to the other speaker..Once they were set up and turned on the decks, was amazed by the clarity and how loud they were for such a small speaker. My set up is in a room smaller than a bedroom and have the speakers quite close to me. Remember these a Near field monitor speakers so probably no good for a big room..But definitely recommend for a small room set up as they have more than enough power.'},\n",

Paid GB£139.00 and Amazon delivered next day..(I notice these are the newest version (Mk 2?) with the jacks above each other and no range switches)..First impressions are highly favourable. Bass is extended with real weight and slam, kick drum sounds true..Mids are clean and the whole audio range is basically neutral and un-coloured..Listening to the tracks I'm working on showed they matched the Genelecs very well and mixes sounded similar. Imaging and resolution are good enough to mix with, quite a surprise in a budget speaker...I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a budget monitor for music or podcasts, or for general AV use.\"},\n",

I was a little skeptical after some reviews had mentioned a static hum due to the power supply - thankfully mine have not had this issue...They also look great too and certainly feel like a premium product for the price paid. I had upgraded to these from some £40 PC speakers and wasn't 'blown away' with the sound, but that being said, at the time of purchase, these were only around £90 for the pair, which is considered to be at the low end for a professional set of studio monitors, so no real complaints there...The only issue for me so far, is that the main powered speaker is definitely louder than the slave speaker, and so I'm having to either adjust my output settings on my computer or change the speaker positioning to try and make up for this (both are not ideal solutions) - hence the reason for 4 stars, rather than 5...Overall however, a decent purchase, which I'll use for 12 months or so before considering further upgrades.\"},\n",

Not boomy or flabby, and they seem to do well..2 - Balanced Inputs : no noise as I am running my Yamaha AG06 into these guys from a laptop. There was no noise using unbalanced cables, but this is defintely prefeable..3 - Super Light-Weight : really light and practical for small work-spaces or portable rigs..4 - Price : superb for £80-£90 Best in class without a doubt...Cons:.1 - Bass Response : I wouldnt use these for mixing lower than 80Hz, as these things simply are not designed for that! The cones are too small, so look elsewhere if you want to mix low frequencies on it..2 - Build Quality : seems good so far, but only time will tell if I am back on here saying they broke after a few months...Overall a fantastic pair of monitors for bed-room producers and audiophiles alike!'},\n",

You won't even realise you've subliminally compensated for their forwardness in the EQ of your mixes until you play your music on more balanced speakers and wonder why your vocals and acoustic guitars sound recessed.\\ufeff..I fully realise with speakers of this size and price it's about juggling compromises, but I know of £30 single-driver bluetooth speakers which are nowhere near as good in absolute terms but which would be better to mix with because of their more natural tonal balance, so I can't help but feel the forward-leaning presentation of these speakers has been a deliberate design-choice to impress potential buyers in A-B in-store comparisons.\"},\n",

Tonal balance is *really* nice for the size and price point; they're nearly as sweet as my much more expensive hifi speakers and amp downstairs. Bass is pretty well controlled and tight, treble sparkly and detailed, and the mids clear and defined. The adjustments on the back make it easy to tweak for your particular circumstances - I had to trim the 'Acoustic Space' control down to -2dB or else the bass was too boomy, which is exactly what the manual suggested would be right for the setup I have them in, close to a wall...However, as others have pointed out, there is a noticeable, although not completely awful, AC mains hum, more prominent in the left active speaker but audible in the right speaker too if you listen closely. Also audible when not playing anything is a high-pitched amplifier hiss/white noise in both speakers. Both the hum and the white noise seem to be the same level whatever the volume knob is set to, whatever is plugged into the mains, which socket it's plugged into, or whatever is plugged into the speakers, although the noise gets a bit louder if the powered speaker has been on for a while and is warm. So it seems that whatever's picking up the noise/hum is after the input stages/preamp - maybe the power amp stage is being pushed a bit hard and/or as others have said, the transformer is a bit cheap and is unshielded...I think I can live with the hum and noise, at least right now. It's not offensive and it's less noisy than some other powered speakers I've had, but for a pair of speakers that claim to be 'high-definition studio monitors' it's a bit disappointing. Guess I'll just have to make sure I turn them off when I'm not playing things on them...Also the package that turned up was the continental European version of the speakers with a two-prong Europlug cable, which was another disappointment.

I then changed electrical sockets but the hum was still there. I hooked up my previous Edifier monitors and they only had a slight hum which was barely noticeable and you had to put your ears near them to really hear it. Then I read the Amazon UK review by Drew Peacock from 4th September 2016 which highlighted the source of the problem. I then contacted the supplier who informed me that they had had several units returned because of the noisy transformer...So it looks as if PreSonus have lowered the quality of the electronics in the recent batches of these monitors, which is a great pity, because in all other respects they were really good for the price.

I have resolved the mains hum issue....but the solution is ugly...So, I bought a pair of secondhand Eris e4.5 a couple of days ago off EBAY ...& instantly noticed the hum in the main active speaker was terriblle. I therefore consulted the net & read of many reports of this hum (I therefore suspected design fault, vs. being sold a faulty pair of speakers). So being of a technical/electronics background, i dismantled the main speaker to get to the bottom of the hum ....alas, it's disappointing to report that I've concluded that the hum is a result of a major design fault by Presonus (I can't believe this has actually slipped passed their Q&A testing)...Presonus have opted to save a few dollars by using a cheap mains transformer (vs. a better toroidal transformer). This cheap transformer spews out mains emf radiation internally within the left speaker enclosure....& because it's a small speaker this radiation gets physically induced into the main power supply via the very large heatsink (which sits alongside the transformer) & then the hum ends up in the signal path...i also believe there is some mains frequency 'magnetic coupling' going on between the mains transformer & the main LH speaker itself. the only way i could resolve (quickly & cheaply) was to extend the wires feeding the mains transformer & then relocate the mains transformer outside of the speaker enclosure (see the attached photo) It's a major hack (& looks awful - but won't be seen in my deployment), but at least my Eris E4.5 speakers are totally hum free now...P.S. I initially thought that the audible hum was down to insufficient capacitance on the PSU ...300mV (peak to peak) of ripple measured on there (Presonus used a modest 4,700 capacitor on each of the two main PSU rails), so I added in a further 10,000uf capacitance to each rail. \"},\n",

I purchased them to replace a pair of Alesis Monitor One MKII as I didn’t have enough space for the larger monitors...I use the E4.5s both for listening to music and for mixing and they are perfect for both. The soundstage is nice and wide and they sound pretty flat for a speaker at this price point. It is worth noting however that they are nearfield monitors and don’t fill a room with music in the same way larger hi-fi speakers might. They do however sound great when you are sat right in front of them as you might when you are monitoring etc...They also don’t have a great deal of bass, they are rated as going down to 70hz, so you may wish to pair them with a subwoofer to fill in the bottom end.

       "   'body': 'These monitors are a revelation!..Everything I wanted in a miniature monitor is basically provided: sounds pop out of the speakers in a three-dimensional way, there is crisp and clean treble, clear and realistic mid-range, and a very reasonable amount of bass for the size. Stereo imaging is good, and I have not found them at all fatiguing to listen to...As with most other ported designs, in an untreated room at close proximity to walls, I find it\\'s best to roll off the bass with one of the \"Low Cutoff\" settings at the back (80 Hz or 100 Hz). But even at 80 Hz, there is still an adequate amount of bass produced for most scenarios, and what is there sounds tight and controlled...Sometimes I\\'ve heard details on these monitors that I never noticed before when listening to the same music on larger, much more expensive monitors. I suspect that\\'s partly due simply to the size of the cabinets - I suspect smaller speakers are going to exhibit less masking of mid-range elements by bass sounds; or maybe it\\'s due to a higher crossover frequency. I\\'m not sure. But it\\'s also a testament to how good these monitors are. Given the price, they are amazing...I have the monitors placed high up, so they\\'re slightly above head level, tilted downwards so they\\'re pointing directly at my head in normal sitting position. I find this sounds much better than putting them low down at desk level and tilting them upwards, presumably because there are less reflections off the desk itself...I did this by placing a pair of Pixel T50 speaker stands (50cm tall, costing £50) on my desk, just behind my displays - the stands are the perfect height to hold the monitors so their front faces are just above my displays. I then used a pair of foam isolation pads to rest the monitors on and tilt them downwards at the right angle. For this I used a pair of Adam Hall PAD ECO Series absorber plates, which are the right width for these monitors.'},\n",
